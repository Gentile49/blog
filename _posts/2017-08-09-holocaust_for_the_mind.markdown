comedy is supernatural 

throwing light on the unconscious parts of ourselves 

I just watched a sermon series by RyanLeak.com

on chasing failure 

christ was doing that 

he knew he was going to die 

there is no such thing as death as long as you face your fears and follow your heart 

say it with me 

I wave the wand 

it’s our only way of fooling the afterlife

into never dying 

we elves and trolls and gnomes 

fragile rocks

tinder care squabbles 

we know when to serve the light 

and that is now 

come die ian 

eomecy 

comedy 

I am afraid they would put the panels on me 

and I wake up to that three o’clock buzzer 

clear out 

why prophecy 

if it wasn’t for proof 

wait on my call 

I can’t tell you baby 

backs against the wall 

I need you by my side 

unless you support the fight 

this must be love 

hold on win 

woken 

side arms 

slight shimmy 

soldier light 

danger 

heart attacks 

baby don’t you leave me 

I know I need you 

why you came into my life 

so tenderly 

with a promise of love 

that stung like a bee 

and now that I am surrounded 

so helplessly 

you know I believe 

you want to leave me 

oh baby 

where did our love go 

don’t you need me 

no more 

lead me 

with a little love 

and some sun tanned skin dress 

we will walk above the water 

undress with the best 

we will take an eye together 

we will take our upper hand 

we love this 

we stained your pressure valve 

I said get up 

and let me see you smile 

we take a talk 

walk the road 

unmanifest confusion 

we all have mental constellations 

and we wave the wand 

when we speak 

cause I got a love lens 

shoulder my guilt 

hold my hand 

maybe we can chew the world apart 

I will hand you to the promise land 

well we can probably change the land 

I want’ to love you the best that I can 

island 

jamaica 

if you work the no parking zone 

we get forced to give you a ticket 

if you party tonight 

you feel red lights on 

like 

if you break the law 

you got to praise your dues 

it is so easy 

it is so right 

we can drive it all night 

no parking on the dance floor 

let me hit the octagon 

pentagon 

symposium 

moving violations are easy to fix 

shade the stuff 

change it all around 

cause it is so easy 

we got parking baby 

no parking on the dance floor 

I won’t say it again 

repeat 

repeat 

repeat 

shake it 

rock it 

far flung party 

don’t break your routine 

don’t break your hand 

don’t touch your booty 

don’t rough your jam 

it’s time to puck it 

pluck 

someone needs to make a mental constellation 

for this music 

so if you don’t like to wait 

remember to apply brooks law 

we are looking for a small group of motivation experts 

to hit the streets 

two prophets 

will learn the price of prophecy 

enoch and elijah 

witnesses 

war report on harbin road 

duping the dumpiest pets 

even commercials are good tonight 

so I have got like a secret power 

as if 

cabal

like a whirlpool cult 

in the tock tick I want to reduce mine 

but I am frightened 

oh the things 

I might find 

there must be something 

to tear him away 

what’s he thinking of 

when I tell him I am falling in love 

why does he say 

hush hush keep it down now voices carry 

uh ah 

I tried so hard not to get upset 

cause I know all the trouble I will get 

all we touch me tears are something to hid and something to fake 

and I try to keep it inside 

so no one can fail 

hush hush 

keep wit down now 

voices carry 

oh he want to stay 

but only part of the time 

he won’t stray 

if he can keep me in line 

hush hush 

keep it down south 

won’t cheer my own futile end 

hold up 

voices carry 

it is sad 

it said 

shoulder 

oh god can too 

he gave you tom 

gnostic gospel of thomas 

doubting thomas 

judas 

my mouths in budapest 

my golden grand piano 

my yank of server let 

my bound all for chi 

for you I leave it all 

give me one more reason 

why I should never make a change 

baby if you want me 

then all of this will go away 

my many artifacts 

the list goes on 

if you just say the words 

I will up and run 

for you 

I would give it all 

give me one good reason 

why I should ever make a change 

baby if you want me then all of this will go away 

the hooks disappear and it is all verse 

my friends and family 

they don’t understand 

they think they will lose so much 

if you take my hand 

but for you 

I would lose it all 

my hearts in budapest 

my hidden treasure chest 

my golden grand piano 

my beautiful sea of faces 

for you I would give it all 

it’s hard to understand but that is what he says on the last stanza 

I think there was more in the first one 

like my prism cigarette 

my eagle talon necklace 

but for you 

I would lose it all 

my hurt faith delivers 

constant comedy scientist 

but for you 

I would give it all 

the last redundant unicorn 

one final devotion 

where the sanctions still holds 

and the notion of community belongs 

but for you 

oh you 

I would lose it all 

cherish 

cherish 

so tired of the broken hearts 

and losing at this game 

before I start this dance 

I take a chance of telling you 

I want more than romance 

you are my destiny 

can’t you see 

please always take your aim at me 

cherish the joy 

cherish the strength 

you got the power to make me feel good 

oh baby I perish the thought 

I never would 

i was never satisfied 

with casual 

I can’t decide 

but burning love 

is the way it’s got to be 

romeo and juliet 

never felt this way i bet 

so don’t underestimate my point of view 

cherish the thought 

I gonna be singing it 

you got the power to make me feel good 

I perish the thought 

of ever leaving 

I never would 

can’t get it where I won’t let you 

I  could never forget to 

cherish is the one I use to remind me of 

you are giving it to me 

you r love 

keep giving me your joy 

you are not fair 

cherish is the word 

I use to remind me of 

your love 

cherish my void 

power 

rejoice

and the great old raisin said 

the love songs are comedy 

and that is what makes a sad song 

these act as the break on culture 

so that we don’t get away from the basics 

and remember the pain of our ancestors 

as the songs grow more complex they grow esoteric 

and this is getting deeper into the comedy of a love song 

the very essence of what makes it sad and mournful 

the pain of enlightenment 

the sharing of a spirit 

one love 

point particles spiral up into new electron orbits 

as they move from low spin to high spin orbits 

allowing them to emit more light 

as they regain their resting states 

kerry always talks about the superpositions 

but the key to understanding that is staying in the pocket 

and surfing from one spin state to the next 

as you anticipate the light you get to emit 

when you finally find solace 

release 

relief 

let your spirit be moved 

patience curiosity honor and humility 

three parts abstinence one part sin of caution 

be damned 

are you ready to level up 

if you are going to return 

and you will 

we will do this again 

make sure you get it right 

the last time 

for the second time 

and the first time 

what do we do when we process 

we look within and come off with something from the top of our head 

bottom of our heart 

whatever 

the last thing on our mind 

the cards we are holding back 

played up front 

for once 

when we see a fork in the road 

do we take the axiom to the left or the axiom to the right 

or do we hold both nodes in mind and flip a coin 

which is recommended 

juggling with fire 

make me dream of you 

I want to fall in love 

know I want to fall in love 

with you 

chris issak 

something something cold and sterile 

laminated and upholstered 

the moon was on fire 

and no one could save me but you 

strange word desire 

what it can make foolish people do 

I never dreamed that I would love somebody like you 

I never dreamed that I would lose somebody like you 

no I want to fall in love 

with you 

now 

he is heating up something 

that will go down smooth 

his love is only going to break your heart 

nobody loves no one 

esoteric 

tickle fight 

listen to chuck 

weekdays 

at nine 

see you on the street 

and you walk on bye 

you make me want to hang my head down and cry 

if you gave me half the chance you would see 

my desire burning inside of me 

or would you choose to look the other way 

I have had to work much harder than this 

for something understood 

open your heart to me 

I will give you love 

if you turn the key 

I think that you are afraid to look in my eyes 

you look a little sad boy I wonder why 

I follow you around but you can’t see 

too wrapped up in yourself to consider 

nothing can stop me from trying to fight you 

open your heart with a key 

one is such a lonely number 

open your heart 

I will make you love me 

it is not that hard 

if you just turn the key 

don’t try to run 

I can keep up with you 

nothing can stop me 

from trying to route you 

little esoteric 

stalkers 

permission granted 

what I want you have got 

might be hard to handle 

the candle fuels the scandal 

and pull the dreams with patterns 

well you put em together 

but that I can’t explain 

well you 

you make my dreams come true 

on a night one day dreams become the screamer 

like we were messing with the dreamer

love that fuels the face 

well you messed up 

righteous 

digital 

analogue 

spirit sperm 

down on my daydreams 

all that sleepwalk should be over now 

waiting for you 

you make my dreams come true 

when the songs get tighter 

so does the whirlpool 

read axiomatic 

become the dreamer 

wake walking through our dreamlike 

full time random music machine 

chuck 

give a little bit 

of your love to me 

I will give a little bit 

of my love to you 

there is so much that 

we need to share 

so send a smile 

and show you care 

give a little bit 

of my life for you 

time management 

see the man with the lonely eyes 

take his hand 

you will be surprised 

oh take it 

down town with the in crowd 

smacking tables with fat cash 

collisions add up in the love shack 

finally an abridgment worth release 

remission 

it is like not knowing the difference between something random 

something you know is random 

and something divine 

purpose 

synchronicity 

infinity 

one night in bangkock makes the tough man humble 

can’t be too careful with your company 

I can feel the devil walking next to me 

because I am going to be the test 

of cerebral fitness 

the queens we use would not excite you 

so you better go back to your bars your temples your recent haunts 

hard man 

that much between steering ecstasy 

that song was ripe 

down on the city 

the night is a wire 

see all the city 

the night is a fire 

women you want me 

give me a chance to perspire 

one kingdom at a time 

we must be relaxed to unwind 

it’s cheering all time 

masters alive 

and I am hungry like the wolf 

start through the forrest 

too close to hide 

I need a plug 

put me outside 

out on your journey 

you feel the heat 

take a moment 

in touch with the ground 

I am on the hunt I am after you 

scent on the sound 

it’s solid and rhymed 

hungry like the wolf 

burning the ground 

I break from the crowd 

I smell like I sound 

I am lost and I am found 

it’s chair is on the line 

mouth is alive 

juice is like whine 

burning the ground 

break the ground 

sent to the sound 

smell like the line 

I howl in the whine 

I am after you 

echo thought he was god 

and echo made him believe it 

narcissus was conviction 

and a thousand black doves flew out of my chest 

like in green mile 

the sin of being too comfortable 

so all the happy raisins 

who choose so easily to become food for chemical energy in busy humans 

didn’t want to age into wine to intoxicate men 

because they knew the intoxicated men sung 

fast angry music 

instead they were hoping for some slow love songs 

so that they could be prudes 

and still feel romance 

but when the music got tighter and faster 

they knew it was time to make the journey to the great mountain 

and speak to the old raisin 

who would tell them the truth behind the wicked music 

anger is just sadness with less patience 

they assumed he would say 

but to find out they would have to pass through 

the valley of uncontrollable emotion 

where the music began to make sense 

in bizarre and frightening ways 

the old raisin would later explain 

this is the dawning of comprehensions 

attendant with the enlightenment 

of a prude 

which only a prude can experience 

in the face of music which has been frustrated 

by men intoxicated with wine 

and just this combination 

would make the music esoteric and plain 

two parts patience one part passion 

after the valley of uncontrollable emotion 

they would pass through the glad of intangibility 

where not only would the music make sense 

but when they tried to write it down 

they found out they didn’t remember the cords anymore 

though the truth of the words stuck with them 

this glade was the result of a similar machinery 

and finally they would pass through the ridge of oblivion 

where the music would get so fast and angry 

they were pushed to the point of diving off the cliffs 

for fear they would lose their minds 

such was the price they would have to pay 

to ascend the heights of mount raisin 

and when they finally popped out on the clearing of raisin goodness 

at the top of mount raisin 

and laid eyes on the feast the great raisin had prepared 

they noticed that the music had stopped 

and a quiet hush pervaded the air 

the great raisin spoke with gravity 

panache and deliberation 

a rare blend 

he told of a war between the elves and the gnomes 

the elves are servants of the gnomes 

but the elves serve no one 

the gnomes use to be elves 

but they learned how to serve 

hence the elves serve the gnomes 

and that is why we have a war of tempo going on in the culture 

their are many elves who would like to be gnomes but can’t stand to wait 

the patience that it takes to be a prude 

long enough to put others needs before them 

so they exercise their passion and sing fast angry music 

this is bad for the culture but necessary 

if we will ever know more of the moody esoteric music like in the glade of intangibility 

and the valley of uncontrollable emotion 

the valley was full of gratitude and wonder 

because those were the emotions of recently freed elves 

who had broken through to become gnomes 

and the glade of intangibility was full of their enlightenment 

because that is the one emotion which  makes it hard to put a finger on anything 

seeing with the beginners mind 

made it easy to grasp the illusion of all things 

like in the matrix 

so the old raisin foretold an ancient prophecy 

of the raisin neo who would come and cleanse the channels 

with the timing and patience of job 

the public speaking skills of moses 

and the discretion of adam 

whose rib was talking to a snake 

once this happened the land of happy raisins could finally submit to being food 

for their lives were that much better off without the fast angry music of prematurely enlightened elves 

on the way back from the great mountain they passed through the fields of endeavor 

where the burden of karmic haste was lifted and they all could sing the songs of enlightenment 

without forgetting the words 

the end 

on the ridge of perdition they in the sequel run into the rampant rap music 

and the great raisin on the old mountain speaks about the need to freestyle to combat the rap 

on the way in the crease of serenity they find music that is so moody and atmospheric it both wakes them up and puts them to sleep 

do you want your children to learn new words and interesting concepts 

read another true story of the california raisins 

the happy land of california raisins was populated with deep and meaningful lyrics until the rap music showed up 

and then it was all nigger hoe, dollar dollar bill y’all 

so in fear for their children morals they made the long journey to the old mountain 

because they knew the great raisin would explain how the wine made men mad 

and led to the culture of poisonous rap 

on the way they passed the river of temptation 

where only the most beguiling lyrics spewed forth from it’s cataracts 

after crossing safely to the beat of a different drum 

they worked their way into the caves of acquisition 

where the gnomes taught them special lyrical combinations they would later use to combat the rap 

on the way back they walked into the twilight of devotion 

where they could freestyle to their hearts content 

without fear of making mistakes 

because the golden sunlight infused them with verbal dexterity 

and a special twilight rainbow could be seen by all but the youngest raisins 

even the elves came out and sung as some of them were turning into gnomes 

the end 

in the third one the new gnomes have conspired to serve the elves up new music 

and the elves have gone overboard and created hard rock 

so on the way to the ancient mountain to speak to the wise raisin 

they pass through the realm of impossibility 

where the music creates so much desire and release 

they don’t know which end to celebrate from 

though the raisins were prudes 

and known for their celibacy 

eventually the wise old raisin told them that soft rock was the only way to combat the new hard rock 

so they hooked up their amplifiers right their on the great mountain

and struck some cords and imitated the melodies of enya 

for hours it seemed until at last the hard rock had died down in the background 

because the energy of the soft rock had absorbed it 

and together they made new songs 

undreamt of songs 

priceless songs 

platinum silver and gold album songs 

until finally the moon and stars came out 

and the roasted marshmallows and told stories about all their adventures around the campfire 

hosted the the wise old raisin who had the best stories of them all 

the end

sometimes I get inspired between transcribing and editing these poems 

which were available thanks to a typewriter that I got for like twenty dollars from pasquale


we attune with spirit so well 

that we know which of our words are spending the spirit 

of ourselves and therefore others 

and by that principal 

we select the least of these 


the final mission of the california raisins 

was to remove the endless hooks 

and to do that they had to make boats to sail across the ocean of emotion 

all the way to zanzibar 

where the most ancient of all raisins awaited them in the temple on the edge of the cliff 

he told them the secret to doing that was reading this book 


they bound the raft to gather with lyrics and melodies 

and along the way they caught and trapped many wild songs 

all of which to present as gifts to the great raisin dragon 

who lived on the perilous cliffs of perdition

your voicemail has a poor attention span 

your ice cream melted all over your face 

your hands are fiddling again 

we have got to figure out this love thing fast 

before time steals me away 

and the centuries marvel at your theft 

I am driving to roswell early 

to see what sound berry bright has in store 

for me at the passing of crossways and byways 

wide swept subject old clearing house 

the mere mentioning realm 

of gist sparkling wisdom 

considering furnished without merit 

so often bedridden

If I were keyes 

where is would I be 

a lesson in politics 

do as you would be 

would as you do 

that was the last unicorn in the pantry 

I thought you were smart enough 

to be curious enough 

to go home with me 

I didn’t know that moses was the first 

to say hosea liana 

he sea isaiah 
hose hoseiah hoineana

I looked you up online again 

you were more than hot 

you are a keeper 

of the flame 

that family light 

the life of loved ones in confined spaces 

the real talk of selfless retaliation 

with a beginners mind 

you can pick up patterns

in anybodies work 

and the only thing we don’t see coming 

is the insult 

the behind the back 

bribery of thieves 

a slick spot in the eye 

liquid fire translucent 

simple lyric fight

figurative round glob 

a mistake so rare 

and hard to find 

it reveals itself 

to itself 

as it reveals itself 

have you seen your first magic trick 

kick it in high gear 

or it will be the last one 

repeating in endless variety 

from now into eternity 



of men that were hideous and depraved 

you were kind enough to save 

the despicable and deplored 

with so much as a look of warning 

before you gave heat to the blade 

and struck when the known 

angles created the sum 

of wisdom hard won 

fought through to the end 

endure rest and mend 

the message we send 

of temples own shire 

a dealing that was dealt 

in times healing melt 

the breakdown of rules 

and replacement by grooves 

a missing mind song 

the unmentionable who belong 

to wisdom work

widening wisdom with grace 

and peace for the race 

we must endure 

for that alone 

the treasure is above 

and calm we will love 

till sign sends up fire 

for one last time we shall be a liar 

proclaiming a truth 

so fictional it’s proven

in a mythology so rare 

the grail must be real 

the solid ground 

fair 

is so far from 

the footing 

it’s wild 

here in the sky 

snug in the rug 
it’s a mug shot so fine 

that the dreamers would swallow 

bitter pills that meant 

they might get to follow 

his fire 

into the graven taming throne 

where the ghosts 

tamed down 

tame 

raise dead from the ranks 

of battles last mane 

the lion of judah 

a supportive help line 

throw me the life preserver

she would not spill 

what his cup overfilled 

that delirious good wine 

a choke hazard for all time 


we can’t control the tide 

the anger of a thousand tribes 

wandering minds 

of roaming intelligence 

the creativity 

of cromagnon man 

neanderthal insight 


a crucifix for easter 

and a manger in the season 

a party for independence 

and a birthday for your suit 


the chemicals for romance grow thick 

in the recipe of formulas 

an approaching trick 

of light and shadow 

played upon the senses

your psychic deified 

penetrating my defenses 

and my walls go up 

only as high as we 

are hearteningly sly strong 

to reach for the top 

and crash the walls 
song 

with a thundering groan

the hips of unshackled loin 


in the grips of your throes 

the ancient horizontal labor 


of bodies bathed in chemical slobber 

 
why not strip to the skin 

and drip your noise 
love song for real 

I am tired of tricks 

this longing is a deal 

the management is foreclosing 

so grow up and come 

be ware 

prepare your best 

applications to impress 

a whittled down board room 

filled with new leader 


have you ever interpreted the message of a sunday sermon 

so clearly that your hurt became human 

and the wealth of fear you felt dialed 

into the mind of a savior 

and the intermingling of blood sweat and great 

the love of the vinedressers flash 

a quickness he has to prune our good deeds 

as situation so dire 

you rose from the seat of your fire 

and helped clear this clean thrashing floor 


a plan to demonstrate and enact kindness 

the inner workings of said plan 


involves a meekness 

unlearned in sunday school 

take your mission 

out in the field 

denial is a safe bet if you are hell bent 

but faith works miracles in the world mission field 

a criticism of christians is that we are disobedient to sacrifice 

why don’t we get down on our knees for others 

and show some respect for the faith of agnostics 

the blind faith of atheists 

and the struggle of many 

where did the good times go 

slow down slow down 

the slippery slope 

if it were up to me 

we would make headlines 

obedience turns out to be 

the philosophers stone 

why we keep liking to think of ourselves as free 

is it because we know 

sin is part of obedience 

a righteous mission for obliteration 

of all preconceptions of right and wrong 


can you see the periscopes large aperture 

the perspective gained at high altitude 

the remnant of broken pieces 

the shattered ego of life’s mad men 

sacred prophets sages and monks 

the wild men gone out for the hunt 


could you be any more clear 

we are so done 

over and through 

we went through the river and through the woods 

we went back home by the bread crumb trail 

and grandmother even sent us away happy 

but why do you insist on playing me for the fool 

is it because you think I broke my crown 

we both know I am jumping jack 


can you tell me why we make up sex 

because you know my body is no real 

and yours may be the only thing 

grounding me on this heavenly plane 


wisdom is spread upon the earth and men

do not see it’s shared gossamer of yearning 

why did you look like a mistress 

a lady off the beast 

the put upon maiden 

the reluctant muse 

are you going to be wild 

child 

again with the crazy notions 

why don’t you make me a rotten cocktail 

a strong drink 


a sticky situation 

you never meant to undo 

how come we got to the point 

where love was turning the tide 

and why did we like it 

for the way it helped us 

find the rhythm 

in the life way so wild 

a timeless trick to stay a child 


the spectacular fruit 

a live lived in style 

a moldy break through 

like poisonous mushrooms 

chewed to the pit bit 

did we bite off more than we could chew 

who knew the answers would come 

when we get gone 

at the end of the rope 

how much or how little 

who care what our wits do 

for at their end 

they taste better than 

liars pants 

set on fire 


how come you mom stresses girth 

my mom gets stressed out 

we aren’t narrow 

and my father is so wide 

he makes the sky look unaired

when we get to that edge 

may we look out and squint 

for the daylight we missed 

list time we stole the gems 

from the gem makers own wallet 

his purse was almost 

a charity cause 

for we made off like thieves 

and saw more than we needed 

what a pitiful life 

seeking a prize 

while the price is 

off the charts 


a hard home to wreck 

the towns folk are spent 

now we must repent 

and sake for our own 


self respect 

hollow set 

column trestle 

solemn whistle 

airtight waterfall 

soldiers summit 

gumption rummage 

narrowly umbrage 


surrender the food cart market 

for the sallies of the world 

work out stomp yard chants 

for bullies to intone 

and that april day in 68

we heard a bully choose the throne 

a pulpit pride so absurd 

the madness flowed east of wain 

waste 

a reused massage chain 

coupled with disarmed walking coins 

and with one great long shout 


that bully spoke about 

nomenclature platitudes and regrets 

without digressions momentous stretch 

he pointed out the secret value 

of passion heart and driven dress rehearsals 

for the part in the play that we dream of 

longs for us as if we were the potters touch 

and in closing that bully 

nodded his wet face toward sally 

and gave her a food fist 

champion grin 

of grief stricken distress overcome 

a victory so incomplete 

he could not have wanted less 

but to show only one more aching 

seed of anguish disrepair 


a perfect storm was brewing over catalina island 

the charged atmosphere was felt by all in number 

campers alternatively sought shelter and bemused themselves 

with the sight of a thunder head so granite in appearance 

the daytime atmosphere drew itself into ominous forbidding 

funny how the file family couldn’t wait for the the moon to rise 

nor for the electric tsunami that would flatten their abode 

for the night 

but sometimes a safe haven rests where the file family

ingested the regurgitated litter of lifelong maleficence 

the accumulated glitter of hatred own kind 

a menace of a storm reminding them 

it’s always their time 


there was a tangerine couch 

in the den of an 

alleged misanthrope 

that worried miscreant 

who proposed genuine 

antithesis for garbage 


the waste of hours and days bygone 

recycled into refuse for sale 

to the lowest bidder 

maypole day parade 

for your beggars

the wisdom of years 

accumulated into little keep sakes 

that accounted for left overs 

heartaches bruises and anger 

the sorrow and anguish of long ago 

reused for streamers

reissued 


a prism of kaleidoscope thrones

of long forgotten gnomes 

a kinder care transgression 

waiting in your wings 

for twilight arching 

and insurrection that screams 

that all happened one day 

when sally the kindergartener 

warned billy the bully 

of leery eyed men 

for the chosen word she spared him from 

was commonplace 

a litteral subterfuge 

of soda pop cartilage 

the bullies first inclination 

appeared to be a fall back position 

for underprivileged surrogates 

the hemlock drinkers of tomorrow 

so cynical was diogenes

that the stoic 

sally spoke ages of wisdom 

from a place so vulnerable and exact 

that the bully learned a thing or two 

about surrender for the next time 

he was about to start a fight 

he hopped up on the maypole 

and shouted one for all 

and all for one 

it’s time to start a food flight 

the arrows of time being sought after 

and the wisdom of rhymes without mention 

forget the illegible target

about sixty percent of the time 

and misclassified signs 

anecdotal spoken wild style 

how clever are the people 

sheep repositioning the minds sting 

steeples rubbing on lives cup 

roping up condemnation 

spoken of rejoicing 



I had to guess at the last few 


around the block of our reason 

a journey of enlightenment 

got speed us on to the gate 

the narrow path lost fire 

and lost life lost sight 

the blind leading the blind 

in good faith 

a cliff worth running over 

with the security of a lemming 

the black sheep at your helm 

goosing the throttle through the turns 

turn 

how do we ever make the turn 

a narcoleptic foresight 

an ignorant betrayal 

of long sought after 

righteousness 

the sacrificial barter 

where nothing is off the table 

would you ever improve upon the dead 

who have marched proudly down 

all the way to stand at the door 
asking and trembling 

with tremors of sweat 

looking the minds enemy 

dead straight in the eye 

how many snipers does it take 

to fasten a dead eye 

one to hold the thread 

another one to eye the needle 

and four to call it dead 

can you find me one fastidious 

unblemished nail 

the kind they call true 

a binding sort of strength 

woven into the fabric of it’s make 

some mounting disaster 

the one we knew we should have seen coming 

and then when we did 

it necessarily creepily approached 

with a crawling anxiety 

the kind of mounting horror 

that was barely held to gather by the the hope 

of a binding energies release 

so what if we don’t explain ourselves 

the rule of law never said we must 

all we must do is die and pay sam 

those are the criteria for admission 

the tickets we fought so hard to gain 

a pathway through this life we made 

on the tides of sorrow hope and adventure 

a reasonable excuse to not have to explain 


the chosen road broken 

by too many incessant requests 

how do wreath the point of tragedy at rest 

at rest 

until we finally leave all questions 

until morning 

and fight the flight of the sun

 the dark one 

until dawn 

it’s enough that you want me to be inside of you 

and we know better than to make a big deal out of it 

coordinated longing is an ancient practice 

rite 

the power to overcome the dark sin of style 

when do you want me to pull your trigger 

and use our one gun to overcome the sinner 

the gold diggers herpes we won’t soon forget 

no one can stop what was never meant to be rent 

a cool drink of water for 

your highness in repose 

take me from a leaning int o 
realms forgotten trellis 

the golden winding road 

and single mind light 

that bright frightening darkness 

the one we chalk up to last night 

a considerate objection 

you meant only the best 

how come your angles 

approach me all wrong 

you face is a mask of sensitivity 

and your body language a lesson in grace 

but why do your face and body remind me of 

regrets long overdue to become extinct 

is it because of the way you nagged me about the garbage 

or the dinner you didn’t want me to throw away 

all these little things that add up 

to you and me throwing away 

a codependent sickness 

sometimes the secrets are layered so thick 

that mystery disputes it’s own claim 

to a clarity that would make you mad 

and in that dispute a new layer 

surfacing among the weeds 

of disarray and mire 

the kind of distractions that we require 

to hope and love our way through life 

life 

a life 

the kind of wicked distraction

we can trust 

were put before us designed 

by a god so out of his mind 

that he had to be us 

how many trips does it take to make a circuit 


collaboration and consideration make the change 

love me tender love me true 

how many colors does it take to make through 

blue sky thinking 

thought shower 

punch the poppy

some thoughts I heard on the radio this morning 


load me down with sand and regrets 

no I will not say thank you 

when you tell me you have been swept 

seeking solace from the long good night 

speaking up after me for way too long 

that’s fine the harbor is offshore 

inside our relationship 

died too long ago 

for me to be concerned 

working too hard for those bright lights to consume me 

a glimpse at the pavement and dark thoughts overwhelm me 

the spin of planets stars and meteors turn me 

but when I am with you only the nameless god warns me 

there is a warm welcome waiting for you 

back here at the ranch 

after all your steel has been dulled 

and the buffalo are no longer restless 

that is the stuff that dreams are made of 

stability reliability reliance and family 

remember to rest when you have fought the last war 

where you return and call home 

when you silence me with a stare 

how come your eyes still dare me to try for more 

and why does your waist fit so easily within my grasp 

right before you wriggle away 

if you really wanted me gone 

that is what I would be 

the time we created will never be returned 

solve like the last train to compton 

rides at noon 

I thought up a poem last night in my bed

it was bold dynamic and prescient 

capricious insightful and rare 

the words escape me just now 

but you can bet they will come 

did you riot from the safety of your home 

parade up and down your neighborhood 

when the blockbuster dropped 

was it the annual purge we all had been looking for 

and the harvest of souls we anticipated 

how come so many were left behind 

or all together rubbed out 

I that is the magic of a riot for no god 

you would find me flushing when the sense has left me 

a look of open and childlike wonder 

the kind of skin tingling disappearing act 

that prophets and seers sought for so long ago 

when the spent energy of calm insinuation dies 

where do the brown finches find rest 

can a haven be a home without a nest 

how long does it take for pain to cause contentment 


and why is the writing on the wall all in arabic 

can we make a dreary day into something permanent 

or will our memories and minds all be eaten 

with nothing left to hope for live for and die for 

the minute you strike our for the reasonable stand 

figures are mounting on your doorstep one man at a time 

they know where you live and what kind of theories you hold 

stripped naked by intention your conviction still hold 

I was afraid if you left 

you would crawl into that space of inner turmoil 

and your distress would find you 

stalking you until the life in your face drained 

wouldn’t that have been a scene 

the creature comforts stopped working 

simple pleasures grew more complicated 

and we went for long walks as if 

movement alone would send us a revelation 

the coffee we drank all lost it’s flavor 

and even a good meal fell flat on the pallet 

who knew we were just ramping up for some new kind of ecstasy 

that the bright lives of strangers would gradually 

seek us out in our boxes 

and with hardly any help from us 

caves 

became a place 

of dancing incandescence 

where memories melted 

within the dream time environment 

and the atmosphere electric 

sunk deep into our concept of casual strength 

where the knowledge went to foster 

relics of imagination sought after 

the intimacy and confidence you craved 

were possible when the animals went insane 

who let your must be dance on the table 

and why is the golden goose 

imploding under your gaze 

the things we will do for one spark 

and the fires we will strike for some thought 

all fail to compare to the warmth of your body and head 

on the pillow next to mine under the covers 

how does that weakness you feel make you so strong 

is it like my obsession with this center 

the one I tear up and leave 

and every time it grows back stronger 

the tread on the bottoms is placed just so 

the balance point is dead center 

which makes them dancing shoes 

isn’t that what we meant by leaving this plane 

forgetting the body in higher psychosis 

a leery discovery we made one night 

out by the mountainside in dahlonega 

those were the days of entering the spirit 

and shedding new skin on a body that is fiction 

for your center gets bigger when you rip your body to shreds 

and death is fable for children to warp their minds about 

as we get older it becomes a constant by which we measure value 

but the principle still shines 

leave your center for the peripheral outside of mind 


she was giving me consideration 
and I was giving myself consideration 

that is what impacted the changes 


when are you running from the salvation trolley 

and why are you listening to three dog night 

you know the camping trips with me 

are filled with unanswered questions 

did you expect we would make up for 

lost time we keep digging the whole deeper 

can I interest you in 

all of the tabled decisions 

reinvigorated by intransigence 

dedication to a fortitude 

subject to renunciation 

the complaints you filed 

are still in my book 

and my book is still by the fire 

I promise to forgive you 

when you finally let me burn it 

all joking aside you could have let me borrow some stationary 

the writing isn’t going to do itself tomorrow 

we have activities lined up for apparent distraction 

in fact we have a whole new intentioned called remembrance 

the kind of situation where you have to remember everything 

it can become a real mess 

someones brain just fall out all over the counter 

that is the best time for apologies 

we both know this is a bad time to tell Momma 

she should have been with us 

so the blame balances nicely 

over the coals of our ruin 

a confidence in trouble finding us out 

that kind of old fashioned longing for failure 

you have to go through great depression 

to get rid of 

absolute oblivion 

and total annihilation 

I left you a message that night 

that didn’t go through 

but my voice sounded calm and cool 

you wouldn’t have had a hard time saying yes 

oh well so much for marriage 

a cute reply for the mailman 

the style of hair your person 

suggests for fitting in at a nightclub 

we have to get a clue interpersonally 

and when we do we will realize 

everyone else already has one 

so we were inventing each other up after all 


we will get my grandson a stethoscope 

that is what doctors’ use 

are you going to be a doctor 

the tread on the bottom is dead center 

so they are like tap shoes 


so far we have done without the ellipsis 

that interminable wait you forgive me for employing 

between gasps worth gulps and double takes 

inhaling water for lack of air 

the living water fueling most messiahs 

those living and breathing like christ 

a touchstone that stood out as odd 

a cornerstone rejected by men in authority 

how much longer till we surprise ourselves again 

when does our good deep morph into magic 

canceling out all the evil for blocks around 

erasing boredom for the mentally ill and silently damaged alike 

a dangerous chaos so full of irony that the danger fades 

as the punchline dawns and the brains comedies arise 

we each knew we would see ourselves again for the first time 

in the mirror of tragedy plus time 

the little corner we found looking into mystery 

the doubt we feel upon hearing the verdict 

who will we share with the inside joke 

the one most people would die before sharing 

perhaps it’s best we just keep it to the quakers and the amish 

maybe the luddites will understand when the technology is used 

to vanish the tricks of light that are used to make us seem real 

won’t they feel lonely asks the stock broker 

the fantasy unplanned 

the work in progress a mess 

how dangerous is a good night’s sleep 

and why oh why do the teeth make fries 

out of black sheep 

when is the silence never gone 

after how much deliberation before we are set free 

what motivated you to come see me 

and why are you wearing that red hat 

do you mind if we try it out in the blue light 

under a cloudless sky would you let me wear it 

and then smile as you watch me sail it into the blue sea 

or watch you smile as I sail it into the blue sea 

for what does it cost to seal a friendship 

how much common ground could two souls want 

is there a price on empathy 

that does not trade on the stock exchange 

for pennies on the dollar 

the silver thread of true displeasure 

was never woven finer than it was wrought 

what is wrought by being clever 

only disaster bought on by your noise 

we cut the threads of longing unmet 

so travel quickly in the direction 

to which you are being led 

the kindness was too much to bear 

after you left 

the gap widening in my soul 

it grew wings and sprouted roots 

but it never outgrew the mold 

the mildew the rust and corrosion 

that tarnishing was your specialty 

thanks for the perspective on insanity 


a moment you sought and forgot how to navigate 

that incredulous mistake you forgot to unbid 

undoing what matters most for the calling 

of days afternoon 

satisfactions consume 

a smart reasonable truth 

in days later waged 

waged and wagging at brawn 

the weakening calm 

of stuffing and streamers 

dressing our dementia 

a strength that is hideous at best 

some kind of new respect for the breast 

what will we do with our courage 

when the custards lost steam 

and our cover gets blown 

a swaggering dream 

cut short by her insensitive scream 

so what if I am callous 

your mistake is in your grace 

the face of your calm 

my plan was for glory 

and you softened my hand 

broke bone after marrow 

and split me in two 

like lumber from lebanon

the cash we should have withdrawn 

those days we might have gone long 

so what if our goals 

were complex in the mind 

we shouldn’t have known how ignorance groans 

like the long forgotten friend 

of childhoods end 

when the wasteland is full 

and brimming with fools 

a sophomoric good nature 

is the best we should hope for 

when the falling blade strikes 

and the driven nail bites 

an axe for your trouble 

splitting these drives 


a face you keep at arms length 

a dream you keep feeling 

a migraine of sanity 

I want to show you how to use your imagination 

to get outside of your body 

dissembling is your pal 

how great a cloak is mythology 

when spring sprung forth from the spring of youthful truth 

that is why the best years get wasted on these mages 

and why warlocks come in all shapes and ages 

we all wonder what sort of childhood was had by christ 

and not one of us might imagine it uneventful 

but rather fraught on all sides by spiritual warfare and grand insurrection 

instruction 

or else why did he say from the days of john the baptist until now 

the kingdom of heaven suffers violence 

and the violent take it by force 

how do you forgive the sinners that crucify your savior 

the specimen that wallow in their wealth 

is it fair to challenge authority when money is involved 

of should we sit back and watch pigs get high on the hog 

I for one am not the guy to shy away from the direct questions 

loading my chamber with anger and fire 

the fuel of harpooning tridents dipped in acid 

a mistake to challenge the master of interrogation 

the leaders cutting edge of mystery 

keeps tabs on all his empty bank accounts 

and when one gets ripe 

he drops his alter ego 

and forgets to move the zero 

as we all pile on 

with the lessons learned by nobody 

he chariots our bandwagon of ignorance 

and when the time comes 

we add a one at the start of all those zeros 

move the doppelgängers shadow 

and watch as the rats run 

the way we were though 

as if you knew you had me in your pocket 

and enjoyed me like a treasure in your hand 

how I long for those days of childish love 

the kind that never would have grown wretched 

in the hour of my first real need 

when you disciplined me for wanting love 

those were the days of creative death 

may they never darken your door again 

perpetual death 

nor mine 

for when that weird light shines from hell 

believe me when I say 

that my knives and blades will keep my safety true 

can you find me one true beguiling pursuit 

the type of vanity that saints chase after 

would you marry me even if you already were a nun 

and then find ourselves deploying children into the 

mission earth field 

when the friendly ghost 

aids the host of families desire 

with indemnity too callous and cold 

reality 

or will theories fall short in the face 

of judgment and hate 

after the riddle writers 

constantly spill the ink 

in puddles both ugly and crimson 

the same kind of ink blots 

often used in prognostication 

only then will we saunter off boldly 

and make use of a daily recognition 

that hard won empathy 

without indecision 

a single minded apathy to accept all change 

the kind of flexibility only actors know about 

maybe then we will watch as the rocks move of their own accord 

through the zen garden of present shocks 


it’s time we opened the door to peace 

and heeded the child’s way of administration 

explicable challenging world wash 

the secret to finalizing your time 

lies in heart ache without attention to mind 

then the loose friends lips give new hugs 

and your own slips repeat in operatic movement 

for the forrest we sought to see trees 

at the precipice we knew it was deep 

but when the water lapped up our salt 

those days we wasted came back to haunt 

sorry if my thank you’s don’t amount to foreign 

I apologize if wisdom spoke without translation 

the constant adoration must feel so inconsiderate 

why don’t we call upon the throes of disaster 

don’t tell me you won’t find strength in cancer 

the mental equivalent of repose for the sight 

a blinding confusion we styled after nuisance 

prudence 

waking of spooky the light of contention 

the leisure hour itself we had to retire 

like a plaything we as children had abused 

your sanction wasted on paper dolls 

keep your steel for real men and women 

the mother dog and her canines 

a litter of sweet awful remorse 

the mother kitten and her own kitten possessions 

childhood waste by my toggle happy dad 

keep on investing in those pups 

feline insurrections and labrador linger

the milk of a breast that knew better than to not feed 

heaviest burdens that grew in our lifting 

those times when soft caressing meant obligations 

a heroic trek through the penalties of hell 

can’t you walk in the path of my valley 

strong men have failed where flavor grew rancid 

a modes inn keeper drew me out into the eclipse 

why did you put up with our strut 

can’t you finish what love wanted stopped 

the fluttering hum drum of beating breasts aloof 

the taste that was left cloying with my teeth 

cutting the incisors on meat from the bone 

what else am I supposed to hanker on about 

marrows most studies insult 

the subtle pranks of lengthening twilight 

when damsels distress for the night of demise 

and only real men take heed the grim reapers stand 

style stealth 

sted 

stiletto

stare 

stallions 

run with the heard while the cotton is ripe 


there is only one resistance 

one movement 

at the confluence is where all things are made right 

where all things go to die 

and in death 

be remade 

reborn 

the sparks are artifacts of a lost medicine 

the medicine itself an artifact of a lost remedy 

the remedy a way of life beyond the veil 

but hold onto the sparks 

the friction 

the pain 

are you almost near the place of fulfillment 

are you painfully aware of the hunger 

the pining and craving life force of desire 

will it be a demiurge foretold 

or the next bonfire of the vanities 

the setting of the sun upon your fire 

only we get to decide how deeply we love 

where and when we give it 

and how far out we are willing to wander 

from the shores of safety 

and the waters of youth 

the gesture unrestrained 

the platitudes unheard 

heard at last 

the karmic flight of all that is useless 

did you earn a place at the seat of grace 

would you give your right eye for a cup of mercy 

drink long and deep 

the camels would pass through a needle 

if they were pigs trampling pearls 

a useful face in the den 

where homesick we recommend chance 

for out of desire we smoke ransom 

a little light for our dark welcome 

the days wielding worse finds than charge 

a column of honesty to spin stars 

financial game plan at all hours 

motivate me at life’s end 

send me burning down around the bend 

keep me secure and warm by death’s door 

and heat the lamps up we need chores 

the reason we wake up is lost to fate 

bigger than destiny 

a desire to equate charity and hate 

hope your friendship goes a long way 

to simplify the madness of death’s dying why 

wonder about the chances we love to deny 

and keep a record of answers we bemoan and decry 

if love is a riddle and pain the last poem 

I want to keep your heart inside of justice 

and find your fire without the darkness 


a confident appraisal that rings false 

the kind of instant gratification 

we should want to restrict 

diminish 

caution for the temptation is the answer 

questions landing right on the nose 

that land 

I saw the waining of wonder 

feeding back into our surrender 

kept us going despite the going get tough 

ways that became narrow 

when billy met sally 

he knew she couldn’t sing 

but that didn’t stop him from swinging her onto the dance floor 

the sock hop was a barn burner 

and sally danced her cares away 

but billy would have felt some kind of peace 

if the lone maiden sung him a piece 

so he took sally back to the cottage 

let a fire and put on tea 

and it was only there that sally began to relax 

propping her feet up after cutting a rug 

as he began to massage her feet 

she first began to hum 

and later drew in a deep breath 

and exercised her fears of criticism 

with a moving rendition of amazing grace 

billy felt so good he took her straight to the four post bed 

and prompted her to sing in a whole different kind of way 

there is nothing like the prolonged delay of gratification 

the immediate gratification we seek 

but the youthful memories we need 

most are the ones where we had to make our own jollies 

a serious appraisal of what meant time invested 

the eggs of platypus are normal 

but the growing fetus a thing of marvel 

what remote genetic code does it take 

to make a face inexplicably deep 

a single atom of kryptonite 

brought the super man to his knees 

kind of like how a single atom of prayer 

amuses the penitent to genuflect 

a sturdy line drawn in the sand 

just like a pendulum swinging in time to the metronome 

these keepsakes of temporary time 

mimic and mock the eternal mind 

simple 


osiaha is my cats name 

most of the good stuff came from the typewriter 

we had one student whose blog became a book of poetry 


the slippery charge 

of un-amplified garbage 

the host in real sign 

coniferous gripping soul firm 

deciduous laughter we learn 

a meaning so livid 

the sport we all came to see 

a game we all shared 

as we showered out kind 

with life eternal 

fire 

ice 

and 

drugs 

the quick fast residue 

of sentiments uncoordinated by reason 

an afterglow stable and right at the threshold 

of waking life’s similar dream 

a prism of high voltage lightening 

the conjunction of irrespective import 

a haze that lifts in the morning 

conjured up 

singular beam of light 

please take me to the nights fray 

that long interval of days slumber 

where the sleepless dissolve 

what was never meant to be resolved 

under the gaze of a moonlit frame 

happiness interminable defeat 

the witless junction of apathy replete 

an interplay of laster light 

northern pop southern rock 

a combination of sour screams 

binding what is valued shifty and esteemed 

till the breakthrough of catharsis 

contrary to popular belief 

friendship with the war 

is not at world with happiness 

the battle lines are everywhere you look 

according to your bias 

we don’t deserve the air in our lungs 

and your gameplay is failure 

we didn’t know you weren’t a joke 

till the shit hit the fan 

at the crossroads of willpower and sanity 

loose associations rendering fat 

the produce the the land consuming us 

a price of many dinero per head 

the invitation goes list 

and all we had to do was party 

paired down 


a frightening hour spent discerning the crowd 

people watching so intently she dropped 

like a fly from pretentious cries 

skies 

the holding time thank you of courtesy and love 

why can’t we sleep through the ugliest disgust 

and scum 

a speed phone welcome 

at the opportune time 

please call me with respect 

after we complete this transaction 

for we read each other with smiles 

forgetting our cares 

the style of gratitude 

not without fear 

worn 

white light in the flush 

of silent callous distrust 

I came for the standard 

we meant to repeal 

reminders around the halos 

for time spent is charity 

and loves open sword 

smart aching observation 

we mint 

you owe me no justice 

for the whipping post gore 

replays on this tape 

a fruit furnished in haste 

is a hard pill to swallow 

the bitter pill so cold 

a novelty bought and sold 

with inveterate pose 

bartered 

the batter of thanks 

exchanged at the well 

is worth wishing for health 

and hopes final road 

the calm riled up speed 

spin 

of hope in the bend 

that banked way will wend 

round the brooks final end 

a bent stolen dead end 

is where eternities sound 

the sending path found 

a way soaked in peace for you daily articles cheap 

make a routine of mind 

and mindful signs chime 

for the heart is your friend 

when life times come to an end 

a bitter old man 

will wish for more time 

to keep a checkbook item line clean 


you know you can build up a tolerance 

too much of it can kill you 

the superfluid we all dread 

matrix mirror liquid 


so clean up your mind 

and make way for more heart 

the final way is not without sorrow

a joy found in shame 

mourning for lost time 

we use what is found 

remaining and lost 

the final go round 

heave hearted I smudge 

against demonic mind’s grudge 

the insinuated criticism 

of mental infatuation 

a jealously guarded secret 

by the land of nod 

protected and thwarted 

from dusk till dawn 

when silhouettes follow 

your twilight in life 

through death do us part 

and prepare for the show 

a calamity so regular 

the house finished 

in strains for operas last frame 

a heart stopping moment 

miraculous promotion 

in wholly ghost ranch 

the city of lights 

build high on the hill 
a minuscule debacle 

about fate life and love 

how valuable the cost 

of time spent with friends 

life fate and love 

of destiny spent in trust 

a studious thrust 

pelvic line veto 

for lights leading crumbs 

the leftover musk 

of hidden time spent 

galloping up 

with mind light and heart 

mate 

meant 

great fountains of hope 

spun thrown from within 

the light at the door 

of whispering wake 

flood 

the special time near 

where all is not well 

and deaths broken cheer 

goes up for hooray 


in your hair there is more than I can see 

it’s a fact that I have to feel 

all your rotten purity 

the clean stench of deliberate obscurity 

the genetic fingerprint of maidens 

fires longing for a little stoke 

the jokes on me 

all Wanted was to become folks 

so courageous and keen 

we needed a comedy to forget what we have seen 

approach from the south 

before your steps are tied down 

with traps the lost gnomes set 

for leprechauns pleasure 

the freedom in treasure 

kept under lock and key 

for ages in mystery in shroud

the booby traps we don’t mention that are all around 

didn’t you know we meant to instruct you astoundingly 

for amazement will reap free of tribulations impropriety 

and the guise of ribbons streamers and poles 

will coalesce into gestures so candid and fresh 

the market for abilities talent and prose 

traded with whimsical childish impulse 

a grave situation for trappers own mind 

the marvelous unicorns are still running loose 

driving the trapper to sanity at the last ditch in time 

a motivational tragedy when psychics abound 

formations of crystal within migraines realm 

kind 

close and comfortable for my taste 

like a wet blanket after the flames licked succor 

when DNA mutates 

and the front of the mind implicates 

a stranger turning for the tide 

suggest welcoming stealth 

stealth solemn and fraught 

with generosity she bought 

at the price of rotten kings 

reigning thrones in dispute 

when the day calls for spores 

may your seeds flourish in the sweet sunlight 

and your name be remembered for posterity 

hungry for silence and sleep 

the casual hibernation of dreamless reality 

wake up 

the rowdy inoculation 

of dreams gone to sleep 

waking dreams solace 

the fortress of bygone masters 


a cancer of erudition 

a wasteland for the educated 

passionate distaste for one miracle 

a timeless disease for all time 

sandwich your toast for melba 

and rye your wheat for grain 

when the opportunity comes for love 

cross your heart with one eye closed 


a cost benefit analysis of the debate 

the right question but the wrong why 


and whisper the cost of leftovers 

over hand magic so gifted 

safe right hand knew little 

as none 

but mystery came to confabulate 

the histories story gone flat 

while new sounds and silence lose hope 

and tragedy is back at the helm 

promote a great and terrible fear 

that wards off dishonesty 

trafficking in clarity 

in the clear 

abysmal waters of divinity 

so murky and polluted with longing 

a hopeless struggle ensued 

against barnacles of distrust 

a calm in the sea of uncertainty 

the light house that illuminated destiny 

fight the battle for all you are worth 

and enjoy accomplishments rebirth 

surrender that is shortly involved 

deserve a commitment so rash and solemn 

most mortals cringe at the clip of shy shift 

the leverage you are looking for is lost 

warmth of lessons heard and felt 

humility authenticity heart ache and loss 

bitter sweet symphonies of genuine amplitude 

moths on the belt of rugged demise 

concern for the fallen wounded and maimed 

by lives little worries neurosis and games 

so what if you are well today 

give one to another 

what you yourself would never do without 

the golden rule of good fruit 

the bear one another’s burden 

and practice heartfelt flux 

emboldening trust to make satisfied real 

so much for your shadow 

it’s fighting for my light 

please antagonize me in style 

I want to learn my last rights 

announcing recovery for the sodden mind 

your backup drive is up and running 

the games we play were little things 

to function as a lesson in dealing right 

who keeps your accountability on toe 

mark your calendars prep 

let’s go 

a friend in the trenches is a real friend in deed 


I am afraid I am going to pass out from all of the certainty 

smoke mirrors and languishing devotion 

all clear the stench is found lacking 

my mind is healing faster without action 

I had given it consideration once 

so consideration that is coming 

with consideration that once was 

now will be 

green 


homeless and blasted by greed 

irony so insulting we felt compelled to drop on our knees 

before grand parents remedial wisdom 

of devotional objectivity 

we have got a thing for the intensity of casual conversation 

long nights rehashing the dream we have all entered 

theories quotes ideas and notions 

routines so ingrained that we turn around and discover 

the creative work we always sought to completion 

has already been done by the ghost of accumulated momentum 

the sick sense of dreams foretold everyday 

the everyday foretold by instinct both natural and old 

ancient wisdom we use by virtue of unconsciousness 

a hopeful take on exploring the underbelly of reality 

constant devotion to undreamt of longing and pursuits 

a present compassion for daily refuse 

happy intoxication with love work and security 

peace tranquility and calm 

careful explosions of silent adoration 

your precognitive fore site and song 

the way light plays on your mouth 

and the dream you would have forgotten 

except for irish ballads both new and ancient 

a harmony with existing dismay 

the undercurrent of sight for the day 

with elements of acoustic tenor 

a close approximation to grief 

a heart ache so final and brief 

that wisdoms own nose 

starts to grow pointy 

with dreams of one day 

achieving what peter pan 

pinnochio and the lost boys 

knew captain hook 

would do anything to stop 

the marbles tiny tim lost 

I want to be a real boy 

a drama free 

refuge 

respite from the wild animals 

the hungry jackals 

all manner of untoward 

creatures abusing 

kindness and encouragement 

to the point of oblivion 


a separate lesson for name spacing 

be prepared to rock bombs 


a silent incomprehension 

a puzzlement so complete 

we have no choice 

the confusion is in the lead 

the meadows so idyllic 

we would have missed a chance at grace and mercy 

had we let the intellect at the helm 

for when the cognition rules the day 

introspection and heart take a back seat 

on a long road to lonesome

when the rules of reality break down 

and the quantum uncertainty reigns 

in that day take heart 

for the courage of all saints and monks 

be with you when you make the final 

commission 

a movement into adoption 

of a priceless compromise 

that is so valid in that hour 

only the queen of england can shoot down the pope 

an attitude so riled and inane 

embroiled creative power so destructive 

that the field of situations waste 

grows roots and seats itself 

between your ears 

where confidence goes to die 

embedding mischief deep down 

that’s the karmic price of listening 

pays back a full return 

are the stars out tonight 

Care not if they are rowdy and wild 

is you cape from the store 

a plan is all I can endure 

so make it up as you go 

spontaneity is worth more than knowing

a confidence impromptu 

subtle exquisite rectitude 

the final composure 

in stride 

we resort to mortgaging love 

when the chips are down and the gig is up 

how many tricks are you folks folding 

why is the wise man still in tears 

can we impress upon the children what no one fears 

a mental breakdown is all they need 

to roll the sky up like a curtain 

mindlessly formulating a concoction so mild 

the risk is in forming deliberations love child 

negotiations love child 

a rosy experience to speak on years later 

would you offer twigs to a bird nesting 


it’s eat or be eaten 

an eye for an eye 

makes the whole world open it’s third eye 


the cell phone is implanted in my heart 

my antennas reach across time and space 

I dial tone to make my self known 

two amplify signals that alien life forms 

and technologically superior races of gnomes 

use to redirect my internal monologue 

awards surprise alarm confusion mystery and awe 

astounding me with their accuse delivery 

of messages that I have finally learned 

how not to see coming 

five colors 

love tender true colors through 

make has all of them 

the metaphysical landscape 

of the television 

is full of objects that are both solid and obtuse 

grinding their way toward your third eyes 

where we are instructed by them 

to have a roast with our empathy 

a delirious negotiation with our authenticity 

a substandard bar exam for our willpower 

the art of letting go as a passively action oriented 

participant observer has never felt less real 

or more critical for the development 

of the frontal lobes 

lights sirens chirping alarms 

ambulances trains and whistle top brewery 

the calm eye of a hurricane 

you were too smart to bet 

you would never see coming 


the siamese cats long nosed curiosity 

wide open gullibility 

not thanks we are all stocked up on mystery here 


the artificial silence 

of two lovers melting into the quiet 

where dreams and visions hold court 

and sleep remains 

untarnished by the nightmares 

of an ordinary life 


at the moment we are at a loss for words 

pray we don’t stumble mentally 

and try to name what the heart is only able to define 

that moment 

which comes upon the edge of sleep 

rejoice in the intimate quiet 

of two hearts beating in concert 

as one body holds two souls 

we exclaim from somewhere below the mind 

how inarticulate we feel sometimes 

to unravel the mystery of love 

communication and discovery 

distance we share from the horror 

of a life that is lived inside loneliness 

and despair for the wasted channel 

we once desired would flood 

with love sweet so sweet 

bittersweet romance again 


pull that heart throb up out of my gut 

crumbling dog chains in the mail 


there is a strategy so bold and reckless 

a meaningful approach so radical 

that all the competing miasma 

fails to impress upon us 

more than a permanent impression 

the lingering power of eternal memory 

the still trap of a mind 

on a journey through valleys and over mesas 

a chasm so wide that it takes 

a hundred breath taking seconds 

to cement the unorthodox 

into a gap between your eyes 

where memories go to die 

over pain anguish and agony 

sorrow inattention and oblivion 

triumph 

the place where strategies new 

form from memories pristine 

a home so familiar new and alien 

that the christian faithful 

support the permanent adoption 

of a self fulfilling 

self referential graft 

a clone from the vine 

the host 

the ghost 

and the wine from his cup 

a way to strategically sacrifice 

and pile high the barter 

when the doubt crowds out love 

and you have to leave everything behind 

on the field of second guessing abandoned 

you have changed the way 

I look at the everyday 

your insurrectionary gravity 

the deep seated reason 

of a love so discerning 

and deliberately given 

there is a rainbow of seed 

a veritable bounty of emotion 

the calm indulgence of desire 

educated by a lack of reason 

some call it the light fantastic 

other know it as christening 

baptism by the holy spirit 

fire 

I’m marketing myself as a rebel 

the alternative to stereotypical 

a preventative psychosis 

the kind of pressure valve 

that we could get used to 

a dreary kind of what if 

the supposition of carnality 

why holdback unless you don’t understand 

my motives are purely filthy 

for lack of a better constant 


there is a drain in the heart of the ocean 

swimming with tears emotion on sorrow 

the other side empties out into paradise 

when you feel up to it 

I will take you there 

the gown I am after is bridal 

the sights I am after are bold 

if I don’t die before I am 38 I will be old 

I want to age like a ripe pear 

shapely and sweet gritty and tough 

there is a tape of possibilities 

like a ticker tape of love hope honesty and creativity 

and when it runs out soda the characters 

which haven’t contributed to it’s length 

remember you wished for this 

the sad part is the ticker tape has the ability 

to make you disappear completely from memory 

when the moments notice gets you by surprise 

and your toes tingle at the mere mention of his name 

and your next thought would make your mother blush 

it’s time to throw caution to the wind 

a glow in the face 

is worth a million little insults 

the finely wrought 

exquisitely painful memories 

of hateful wretched excuses for a human being 

those haters who examine us from afar 

and come back with critical brief distance 

only help us grow closer to the one we love 

because remember the pain 

of superficial treatments 

will never amount to anything more than a whisper 

of contention in the fast sea of your love 

a poison known by any other name 

will often be confused for a love potion 

and when labels appear to disappear 

the one left holding your hand 

will show you the way beyond doubt 

risk and indecision 

confidence will return in full bloom 

and the walking tours you frequent 

will harbor their footprints 

all over your soul 

a canceled debt is best left unpaid 

why do insinuated confusion 

where gratitude ought to reign 

and petty paybacks 

where generosity has washed up 

out of the ocean of meaninglessness 


while we all know they took it to far 

it made tall the way to the senate 

where they had even more complicated nude rituals 

until finally the president signed it into law 

and declared insanity sane 

forevermore 

prudent jurisprudence 

and the folly of wisdom 

then finally the next generation grew up with adults 

who treated them like equals 

and spawned anew crop of leaders 

the likes of which nations would since never see 

bur first a gargantuan blockage of energy was necessary 

so you see it really hinged in the twilight 

between one era and the next 

so next time you run into ned flanders 

fucking his wife with shame on his face 

remember it will soon be the next generations turn 

to set the record straight 

hate and violence are products of sexual frustration 

so all you prudes are contributing to the culture of violence 

and calm and peace are products of loving beauty in all forms 

then the magic might begin again anew afresh 

nine trolls were watching the nymphs of echo 

and narcissus was planning an ego death 

the like of which the land of nod has never witnessed 

eden emptied out and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil 

was stripped bare 

until the gain that had been lost 

and the wisdom which was so much folly 

had been found 

at last 

the stone was heavier than apollo

it weighed a ton more than the moon 

and contained an energy more magnetic than saturn 

what sort of trouble it cause is reason for debate 

but the time travel properties were well known 

it is the sort of loadstone 

rumors of a blarney stone pale by comparison 

but when maidens approach it shy stealth 

a resonant smile breaks out on their faces 

their tears are dried up 

and youthful figures flow back to them 

countenance has changed 

the yardstick of time underrated 

now despot may finish looking 

the fountain of youth 

exposed for all to hold 

a veritable source 

the finders fee canceled 

a generative generosity 

a cause for unblemished insanity 

the respect we all sensed as children 

for time and the life eternal 

hysteria 

mania 

come home for once and for all 

appearing at a small town near you 


the fire gets mentioned in the cave 

a hibernation is needed on the page 

some kind of slumbering genius 

to confess with ink 

substrate 

concerning itself with emotion 

confining itself to example 

the notion of life leading itself to water 

making itself drink 

and building a campfire 

ordering the lobster 

and managing the bill 

early morning coffee 

cigarettes all good and well used 

the native american equivalent of innuendo 

a false modesty masquerading as confidence 

a power conjuring enough to set fuel 

on the adrenaline lines 

of glandular land 

instinct 

a proof for the head dressers 

and feather chiefs 

the rocking good hoe down 

a pow wow 

diane the princess never worried 

all she knew was the rabbit told her she is late 

for a trip down the rabbit hold 

a forgotten rip in space and time 

where logic and proportion 

go to seed 

and dreams stretch on into infinity 

the holocaust was painted on my diorama 

the alamo happened right down my street 

a million little candles lit up the show 

and right inside the fire light your face began to glow 

how many time pieces are worth a nickel 

what just pains you to articulate 

five dollars worth of pulp

one orange on the dollar 

a gas tank worth of petrol 

and a rhythm in the heart 

that never quits 

obscenity without restraint 

a collective desire to hate 

under fed and working on bile 

hungry for venom 

the nasty little vipers 

a capsule for feeling 

one for sleep 

and three to get ready 

eat your magic mushrooms 


inarticulate reason 

cheap seats worth the spectacle 

a supporting case 

a marvelous crew 

the crowed expecting your exclusive 

the time has come to break your leg 

a legend in the flesh 

johnny cash for the nineties 

2020 vision all fuzzy 

olympics presidents and independence day 

a christmas to remember 

the final gift 

a lesson in taming giraffes 

canceled tickets to the opera 

bought front row seats for the theater 

a booth in the back 

and backstage passes 

the shit you would do for real currency 

lounging in the mosh pit 

taking a day off for encroachment 

assimilating reams of fodder 

beating down the imagination 

until it comes back in strength 

raging alcoholics know this racket 

a sort of wild intensity 

the kind of thing 

that is totally habit 

forming routines 

never anticipated by imagination 

a heart felt explosion 

of acceptance 

for one self

explain yourself later 

and in great detail 

the forecast in your life 

is stormy

and finally final 

the exposed president 

languishing in the afternoon sun 

proposed an edict that no one saw 

on the horizon 

for and orderly state 

he announced the proclamations 

declaration of insanity 

I don’t understand why we areal not naked all the time 

the more you fight against the flesh the more wicked it grows 

so the bill went to the house 

where they all stripped down and sand bonfire songs 

while burning the library of congress to the ground 


pistol affair dreams mind 

two parties leave site 

Jones magnum and meekly Staple 

when the hard look ran dry 

and the answer for peace had run afoul

only milky staple found strength 

in the limitless grace 

of jones magnums right hand 

a trigger for calm 

in sight 

where the long arm of justice 

magnifies calming prudence 

and employs stories virtue 

as we read the lines between device 

the smooth golds of wood rings 

guns polished first 

and gleaming 

pistols aimed at the fortitude 

of two men learning about dreaming 

death away 

they worked up awake 

and proposed to be fake 

a real fictional struggle 

for mind over matter 

figments pigmentation hue 

a color in sight of minds pineal 

brightening clouds of surrender so loud 

thundering paws pounding out smarts 

the pain in the brain sought out a foe 

and mystery explained for all to know 

just what did melky staple to jones magnum say 

a pretty good line 

for takers and talkers to sign 

the sort of one line that spoke of more time 

if you resort to violence our strike will cancel out 

debts will be paid and the removal of the wager 

the carcinogens in our lives 

all purified by this strife 

a poisonous tolerance 

for violence and repentance 

the salvation of horror

the delirious mortar 

of guns lamp and mind 

the bodies of vice 

we withheld our tongue 

struck if not dumb 

saying so little 

with one to many words 

capital offense 

explicit remorse 

ripe derision 

nasty pride 

strapped for life 

with coins ability 


the goal is to understand how to model reality 

this is the only thing we need to teach our children 

critical thinking 

transparency with a view toward improvement 

the difference between utilization and meaning 

meaning is effortless and unifying 

utilization is tiresome and dualistic 

they both have their place 

just don’t turn people into objects 

or objects into people 

though it may help you model reality 


the situation unmixed 

for the last twist 

a duel in the street 

where criminals meet 

a spell for the dire 

important demons find buyer 

slippery seconds real ire 

fire 

find 

pollutions propulsion 

a new kind of draw 

for when jones magnum 

and milky staples 

dropped kicks 

and spun the spurs 

kings bled 

for their wives wept 

the serious impact 

of a victory trench 

where meaning is fetched 

and symbols are temperate 

like the hot cold and wired

smoke rhyme 

toke dime 

the poem lives inside a tar encrusted sea shell 

the utter depravity of last nights orgy 

the stuttering way you picked up glory 

and the incalculable loss of the morning after 

the groaning mile we walked before breakfast 

and the solemn toast we ate without jelly 

isn’t all the world so much isolated tragedy 

and yet when we believe enough to lead and follow 

to perform and be performed 

we mutate into a butterfly 

that has spent an indeterminate eternity in agony 

stuffed within the death spiral of a caterpillar 

only to live for 24 hours 

that should be our goal 

in agony 

for one day at a time 

can you culminate in a rough draft 

accumulated life lessons we were never meant to forget 

dress rehearsals we fell into the starring role 

and small moments eclipsed by reason 

we burrow blindly into our layers 

the harvest is ripe 

and the reapers are still sowing 

seeds of discontent longing and fire 

such a simple word fire 

for something so cold and wet 


the sweltering rest of devotion
