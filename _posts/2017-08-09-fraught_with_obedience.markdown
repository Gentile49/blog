because I won’t give in 

I didn’t mean to turn you on 

when I took you out 

I knew what you were on about 

ruined in the end 

what was the move about 

was it on a glass 

don’t you mistrust 

love is falling behind 

what was the wrong 

thought I would move design 

sit this one out 

in between 

what I find is reason 

and I am solving fine 

and I am loving you 

It is just no good 

your teasing like I should 

what was that about 

soup turned out to have a heart of glass 

soon we will keep 

all class 

and buy our own illusion 

worries never mind 

and a hug 

a hug 

born into the  revolution 

in between 

what I find is reason 

love is so confusion 

you are teasing like a good girl 

it doesn’t matter what I say 

as I long as I sing fast 

it makes you feel like a man 

so little truth with that reflection 

well I treat nothing so far 

well I could keep it up as long as it takes 

well it don’t matter who you are 

if I am doing my job 

it is your resolve that breaks 

the heart brings you back 

on that you can rely 

there is something amiss 

I am being insincere 

in fact I don’t mean 

any of this 

still my confession 

draws you near 

to confuse the issue 

or afford 

so many heroes 

no matter how far 

so little use in  getting a car 

the heart brings you back 

suck it in if you are rintin tin 

make a spin move 

this symphony is not contained 

and I can beat these feelings on the shelf 

and so much for suicide 

we will catch all of your tunes 

and when I say I want to pay to pray 

that is what it was 

chew up this clover 

we got the hold on new 

so believe it 

stand by while the system reloads 

now don’t try to change him 

just leave him 

you are not the only that’s conceited 

let’s believe it 

so what much 

for the easy lover 

if I fall along the way 

pick me up and dust me off 

if I get too tired to make it 

be my breath 

so I can walk 

if I need some other loving 

give me more than I can stand 

if my smile gets old and faded 

than we will spill the beans again 

if I couldn’t sleep 

could you sleep 

could you pain me better off 

just phoning it in 

just breaking the skin 

I hope you know what I meant 

the star bending need 

it is never enough 

star bending me 

keep bending me 

until I am completely 

broken in 

should not be so complicated 

can you help me 

I meant 

we can call on the fire 

from without side the end 

mole courage sandwich crime 

any chance you will stab me 

why not stay compatible 

where the weird whine moment

slips through the exception 

would you want me 

through sleep 

a bigger candle flame 

shattering there is no eternity 

we see some passion 

and circumstance 

in your name dermatology 

my fantasies turn to madness 

and all my goodness 

has turned to badness 

why would you possess truth 

it has some answers 

I almost attend shoe 

you love her 

so late to bruise 

love stinks 

I have the blues 

two by two and side by side 

one divine 

enjoy the love 

shoot the dove 

chew the love 

I have been through diamonds 

I have been through thinks 

we made a glove 

staff under remove 

caught in a fight 

on a brown beach 

I met strange lady 

she took me in and made me breakfast 

she said 

I come from a land down under 

where women roar and men thunder 

she said you better take cover 

buying bread from a man in brussels 

he was six foot four and taking names 

can you hear that thunder 

dying in a den in bombay 

with a snack jar 

we got much to say 

I said to the man 

are you trying to tempt me 

cause I won’t tempt you 

where women glow 

and men thunder 

living in a land down under 

where women fall 

and men thunder 

the women flow 

and men thunder 

the ask and tell is ruined 

so lately been wandering 

who will be there to take my place 

when I am gone 

who will need love 

to light the shadows out of place 

if a grade away should fall 

what most haunts me is knowledge 

the shadow stomps on condors 

I will go wherever you will go 

and maybe I will find out a way 

to make it back someday 

to want you to guide 

you to the blackest of your days 

if a grade away should fall 

should fall upon us all 

well a grand piano mends intransigence 

run away with my hook 

I know now just quite how 
my life and love just still go on 

in my heart and my head 

I will stay with you until the end of the fall 

if I grow and you recede 

I will turn back time 

I can see the path you are cutting 

comes to me in the place of my heart 

you are such a dumb little sister 

listening for a fight 

you better let some body 

tempt fate 

you are gonna push somebody too far 

one night 

you are eyes wild 

skin white 

you got the tough little image of a perfect man 

you are gonna pull the tick a little too far 

I am only saying what I feel 

I thought that you were driving 

I was falling asleep at the wheel 

don’t wait 

you better love somebody 

you are gonna pull me just a little too far 

who climbs 

whole on little girl 

show me what he has done to you 

fake the twist with both of you 

when it’s over it’s over 

build up your confidence 

so you can be on top for once 

wake up who counts 

for who can follow confidence 

waited on a line up 

fooled the stage 

why be alone 

you gave my life to save it 

when it is through 

fake the twist with both of you 

come on over 

come on baby 

I am the one who wants to beat the news 

laid it on line up 

line some goods 

if heaven wants sower 

if heaven wants time 

a place to be in the moment 

a wild rhyme to be rhymed 

sometimes I never leave 

sometimes is good 

sometimes it frightens me 

something it should 

it keeps me standing still 

it takes all my will 

and suddenly 

last summer 

once summer never ends 

it keeps me standing still 

stained panties filled with skill 

once summer never begins 

I built a house so big and loud 

I jumped so high 

I loved the sound 

please don’t wake me now 

I howled at the moon with friends 

then this song came crashing in 

built all the possibilities 

I am never gonna give up 

just keep me loud 

I hear it calling 

outside the window 

my soul was on the ice 

I see it calling 

where fear goes down the bend 

cool cats fact check 

raising up 

back on the street 

know the strippers did my taxes 

why the splitters mattered 

sometimes it happens so fast 

we just clashed in the wild 

and his fortune is over 

we are love 

hanging tough 

standing hug

we could skill fight 

through rhyme 

and he watching his head 

load the end of the tiger 

white lies in the silo 

where the files grow in silence 

the city streets are empty now 

and lights don’t shine no more 

and the smile won’t float off now 

the everyday swim pile 

I turned to stone 

when you were gone 

my daddy swum all night 

the tighter streets that hide away 

what cash you stocked into the bank 

the less green shadows shoot off the wall 

I less these facts when you sweep off 

spring ripe setting kind 

two o clock this morning 

I wouldn’t dream of calling 

she has got a heart of stone 

cause she is white 

well teacher see her standing there 

see how she looks 

see how she cares 

nine o clock this morning 

she climbed the prism 

for me 

she is heart and soul 

hot loving every night 

so how we stole 

hot loving ever night 

many times I tried to tell 

many times I cried alone 

I want to leave you reeling 

I have wasted too much time 

to cloud the doubt that complicates your mind 

we belong 

together 


maybe it’s a sign of weakness 

maybe I just wouldn’t know 

what should I say 

have we become a habit 

do we have some force 

no we say we belong to the night 

we belong to the fervor 

when you sing it turns hearts and minds 

but facts check accuracy 

wait and try your best 

to try and watch reality 

we can do it doubt 

I know already 

I have got too much to say 

we belong to the sounds 

before following love 

we belong to the light 

we belong to the dove 

whatever we combine 

embrace 

oh well imagine 

as I pace in the pews of a church corridor 

I can’t wait to hear 

what exchange comes into words 

rhyme when the poison sticks 

I am close to covering shave 

I want to call for a close 

I dial in 

haven’t you people ever heard of 

closing the gone dog door 

what support do you abuse 

there is a party going on right here 

a celebration 

clues last throughout the seer 

some of them want to be abused 

each reach is reigning rams 

cool sam 

get proud 

have yourself a merry christmas 

never made it as a wise man 

I am sick of symbols 

this time I won’t wish 

one flew over the cuckoos 

cause living women 

must have damn near killed you 

lace my words is my head 

sweep my words in my head 

leaving out of his home 

with a dollar in his pocket 

and a note full of leaves 

he had a troubled time 

but we kept him excited 

now the gospel is closed 

for we headed to the coast 

and the wisdom 

hell is a pardon 

she passionately disembarks 

young heart 

be free tonight 

time is on your side 

billy wrote a letter back home to patty’s parents 

trying to explain 

he said his heart is really sorry 

so he just ran away 

but there ain’t no point in talking 

when the christians aren’t kept at bay 

time is on your side 

waiting on a sunday afternoon 

oh when I read between the lies 

feeling like a hand that lost the chain 

so do you laugh at those who cry 

with life 

leaving on a southern train 

only yesterday 

you lied 

promises what I seem to be 

washed in time 

breathing is the hardest thing to do 

with all those steps I step beyond for you 

leaving on a southern train 

only yesterday you lied 

promises what I seem to believe 

only watch the train go goodbye 

last night a little dancer 

came dancing to my door 

last night a little angel 

she said I come baby 

buy a license for love 

and if it expires 

bring hell from above 

she said I want rebels 

she is am mc babe 

what set you free 

and brought you to me 

I walk the wall with you 

a thousand miles with you 

I would drive your tears 

with pain 

a million times 

with you 

I would sell my soul 

with you 

for money to burn 

with you 

I would give you hold 

and pay dirt 

progressive presents 

mind phone west 

print play 

win 

we walk into the carport 

piss on a few through 

shift sound 

let the good times roll 

let the stories be told 

let them say what they want 

the the photos be old 

let them show what they want 

let them wash rock and roll hair 

if the illusion is real 

let them give you a lie 

if they got undue appeal 

let them be on your side 

let them leave you a rock and roll style 

i see who battles the horizon 

I see new trouble 

on the way 

I see the hurricanes and quakes 

I got to go out tonight 

just get down tonight 

we can finish what is light 

hope you got your things together 

hope you are quite prepared to die 

looks like we are in for nasty weather 

on eye is taken for an eye 

save him now 

working on the wrecking machine 

won’t you pardon my roll 

don’t believe me just watch 

sure enough 

we be about it 

shout who wants it hot 

do you believe in heave above 

do you believe in love 

don’t tell me lies 

don’t be false or untrue 

open fire 

don’t tell me mind 

go down into fire 

if a girl walks in 

work her around 

empty dreams can only disappoint 


in a room behind your smile 

but don’t give up 

it gets in your eyes 

it makes you cry 

looking for love 

calling heaven above 

send me an angel 

where is your toast 

butter me up 

bible harsh welcome snarl 

I was born to love 

I was born in slums 

but I have what I can take 

I don’t have to pack my bags anymore 

so why don’t you turn me loose 

I got to do it my way 

or no way at all 

I got to do it my way 

I want to fly 

I am hear to please 

I am even on my knees 

making love to whoever I please 

and when you came around 

you tried to tie me down 

I was such a clown 

you had to have it your way 

but I am saying 

no way 

so white 

you turn me truth 

so long ago I don’t remember when 

that is when this day motivated cream 

it’s when we died 

and the listening speed 

was lonely at the cemetery trees 

I always saw a pretty face 

I think sometimes 

I love to watch it purr 

so one red light 

she said it’s cold 

it feels like independence day 

but there has got to be an opening 

somewhere here in front of me 

in this movement of ugliness and greed 

we hate the edge 

like a spilt kiln 

my heart is lonely 

this place is old 

it feels like a beat up truck 

well it sell a ton of cigarette 

the old man may be still breathing 

exposing yourself as an artist 

threatens compunction 

and love 

just another feedback 

noise sound in the system 

birds came flying from the speed of sound 

all those sings and you won’t be bad 

some things you can’t invent 

some get made 

and some get sand

cruel fate 

when the song is on rewind 

we could use to be reminded 

what comes before us 

will not last 

for in order to avoid the interference 

all love songs must be heartfelt lies 

or suffer the fate of original originality 

the one zone of preposterous declarations 

it is just like being a christian 

and knowing that god is cruel and absent 

however the law can remind us of his fire 

while at the same time knowing that he is good 

and we will never measure up 

so we keep trying to play with the fire 

and all we can tell are true lies 

open lies withheld more truth 

the can opener and the worms 

it is like knowing something can’t be possible 

it is deceptive 

proof beyond rapport 

measure the changes 

and utter the phrases 

that make the changes possible 

remember when the audio feedback 

was the perfect embodiment 

of our emotional indecision 

that is when you know you are close 

mistakes 

perfection 

so we keep writing songs 

and the audience keeps 

keeping up appearances 

because we are setting traps 

meant to be sprung 

and in this way 

the music evolves 

sometimes in real time 

always and forever 

waiting for the time to pass you bye 

I know you are grown 

and we don’t have to 

be the best possible options 

all we have to do is stay 

won’t admit what I already know 

I have always been the best at letting go 

and you can stay too 

lighter shy mindless wild 

oh how much regret is appropriate 

all of it 

and then forget 

people try to put us down 

back together 

talking about my generation 

when the smattering of grief gets old 

we are not gonna take it 

know we are not going to take it 

we have got the right to choose it 

there is a way 

we will lose it 

we will fight the powers that be cause 

you don’t know words 

you just belong 

I am just writing down what the songs say 

I will be called so condescending 

cause we want to try to fade it 

one life wants best 

we will fake the streets 

we we’re right

we we’re free 

will power 

deeds

you are all worthless and weak 

hose ran from candles 

leaves are falling all around 

time I was on my way 

next to you I was much obliged 

such a pleasant stay 

but now it’s time for me to go 

the autumn rain lights my way 

but now I smell the way 

and it’s long and snared 

got no time for spreading rules 

the time has gone for me to go 

and though I drank ten thousand times 

it is time for me to ramble on 

roll my way 

I got to find the queen of all my dreams 

the mind is a tale that cannot be told 

I feel it I hold dear 

years ago when days of old 

when magic filled the air 

in the darkest depths of mordor 

I met a girl so fair 

but golem the evil crept up and slithered her 

your love is like a tidal wave 

spinning me over my head 

loved me and my promises 

don’t write what I said 

your love has set me soul on fire 

the ways you fold me up 

you are a heartbreaker 

dream maker 

love taker 

don’t you mess around with me 

you are the right kind of sinner 

to release my inner fantasy 

and you know that you were born to be 

sire smile hassle free 

cramped style wander home 

we should have seen 

buy the look in my wet eyes 

should have known by the tone of my voice 

we could have been 

but you let it steal in my rest 

oh court up a listen 

I know I know all about those courting men 

still I don’t remember 

cause it was us baby way before them 

and we are still together 

and I meant every word I said 

and I meant what I meant 

we are going to stay together forever 

I don’t want to sleep 

I just want to keep on loving you 

when I said that I love you 

I meant that I love you forever 

I am going to keep on loving you 

you could have a sweet train 

if you don’t stray down your tracks 

you could have an airplane flying 

if you bring your new scar back 

all you do is call me 

I will be anything you need 

you could have a big dipper 

running up and down the set 

I want to be a sledge hammer 

all you do is call my name 

this will be my test 

caught me around your fruit cakes 

cause I will be your honey bee 

open up your fruit cakes 

where the sweet fruit is all I can be 

I am canceling our debt 

your known meaning 

switch 

I will get it right 

I kicked the habit 

shaved my skin 

this is the new stuff 

I go dancing in 

won’t you show me 

I will show you up 

brain 

the brain perceives extremes 

it is up to us to add the spice 

organic 

I propose a toast 

my big feet in the river 

reckon gold dust woman 

take your silver spoon 

take your brain 

godless journey 

take your prayer 

but I will pray 

wake up in the morning 

see your sunrise burn as it goes down 

lousy lover 

think they pray but they never cry out loud 

well did she make you cry did she make you break down 

shatter your illusions of love 

well is it over now 

do you know how 

pick up the pieces and go home 

reckon ate some weeks 

follow those that pair in your shadow 

appear 

rulers make bad lovers

you better put your kingdom up for sale 

who made a showdown another woman 

black widow 

pray to the shadow 

dark woman

who impaled shadow 

what woman 

black widow 

who felt shadow 

was it trauma 

fast food 

we might know 

you can’t put a candle in the wax 

you can only burn the wick 

monday is a crime 

who was supposed to find the fence 

riding out deliver 

finish the spin 

the world is love and light all need 

maybe as the skies are wide 

today’s tom sawyer 

he get’s high on you 

in the space he invades 

he gets wild on you 

know his mind is not for rent 

to every god and government 

host the waning moon 

those changes are permanent 

the world is love and life 

maybe as his eyes are white 

exit the warrior 

the energy he betrayed 

he gets right on thought 

the fiction that is today 

grow up son 

won’t you please hide 

we need you in the partridge 

parsonage 

I come in at five am 

and she is waiting for me 

she said where have you been 

she said you are no good 

because you have been running without love 

the black widows in the lady’s man 

we drug down the window sash 

what love we may have burned 

running down the sound of the sea 

and I can’t afford to like a rolling stone 

get out of my house and get into the cold 

I am going straight to hell 

just like my momma said 

the stars came out and warmed me so 

as I walked around on the road 

fifty books and a suitcase scared with greed 

she walked me down and she called me son 

I turned around and shouted 

help me mother 

how about another 

up above the view 

I will be a hero 

I am going straight to hell 

just like my momma said 

the gift of interpretation 

I think people fear we are attracting the cops 

but a good christian does not fear the law 

I mean that in every sense of the way 

disappear into mercy and truth 

dissemble 

tell the lie which is a natural part of 

being a fully flesh eating spirit 

because the truth can send 

a good soul to hell 

or a bad soul to heaven 

and vice versa 

visa versa 

so we intone 

stress relievers 

excessive smiling 

feeling more relaxed 

hold out for more love 

high standards 

king sized fire forgiveness 

the stolen fire was forgotten 

for the light was so pure 

we thought it never happened 

when you disappeared 

there is a story in my eyes 

turn the pages of desire 

now it is time to trade those dreams 

for the rush of passion’s fire 

rushing back tonight 

I can feel it when we touch 

looking leery for clues 

to make the story line come true 

can you feel it when we touch 

the trembling hands of fate 

I can’t hold back 

I am on the edge 

you love signs explode 

inside my head 

another shooting star 

goes along 

and in the night the silence 

speaks to you and I 

and now the time has come at last 

don’t let the momentum rush 

and there is a story in my eyes 

trim the pages of desire 

and now it’s time to trade those dreams 

for the rush of passions fire 

I can’t hold back I am on the edge 

your love sounds pound inside my head 

girl it’s too late to turn back now 

this love affair can’t wait 

they are all christian songs 

the greatest lie 

is that the believer and the secular 

are reading from two different scripts 

so hot storm the end 

I saw you again 

smile like the sun 

kiss is for real 

it is real 

you write the song down in my wake 

I toss you a fire from my grave 

now won’t you 

barracuda 

back over time 

we were a trial 

we feel 

you never quote it to me 

no right no wrong 

saving a song 

a deal 

wished again 

and if the real thing don’t do the trick 

we better make up something quick 

who is gonna burn me to the wick 

stand me 

sell you 

my prize is drowning in plumes 

all that night 

swear in our boogey man 

we lift us in stoops 

silly silly fools 

you better make up something sick 

you better burn burn burn me to the wick 

awe 

barracuda 

would you rather learn more about love or hate 

ask and tell 

the looney tic 

is on the grass 

memory games 

we are all following jim 

the paper holds their folded faces to the floor 

and everyday the paper boy brings more 

and if the band breaks open and many years ensue 

and if there is no room upon the hill 

and if your head explodes when darkness follow true 

I will see you on the dark side of the moon 

the lunatic is on my head 

you raise the blade 

you make the chain 

you rearrange me till I am sane 

you lock the door 

and throw away the key 

there is someone in my place3 

and it’s is me 

and if the cloud burst 

thunders in your ear 

you will slide into july 

hunting august 

and all those wild lost forgotten questions 

like who when where and why 

nobody say what 

I am thanking the noise 

I am taking his long work 

I can complain about the calm stork 

all that you touch 

all that you see 

all that you love 

all that you hate 

all that you distrust 

all you create 

all that you buy 

beg borrow or steal 

and all that you do 

and all that you say 

and all that you see 

and all that you might 

and every thing under the sun is a shoot 

bamboo 

how come you love me baby 

mister leader can you see 

if we are in bed together 

we might long for solitude 

but the worms 

eat their way in 

cause someone down inside 

someone is saying 

love doesn’t last that long 

like silence 

and mister leader can you say 

why come you fried 

someone is gonna hurt yourself 

please register for me 

there is noise 

fight with a new friend 

we use to be real close 

said who could go on the american way 

bought a shop on a ticket to the west coast 

now he gives them a stand up routine in LA 

I don’t need you to worry for me 

cause I am all right 

I don’t want you to tell me 

it’s time to come home 

and that is the struggle 

running from god 

disappearing 

into the mystery 

I still belong 

don’t get me wrong 

I was never not a victim of circumstance 

you can speak your mind 

I won’t say a thing 

they will tell you you can sleep your life away in a new house 

but either way it’s okay 

you wake up with yourself 

jewish worry 

time to come home 

we carry shame 

and I am wrong 

I never said you had to offer me a second chance 

I never said you were a victim of circumstance 

I still belong 

don’t get me wrong 

you can speak your mind 

but not on my time 

like I care what you say 

this is my knife 

keep it to yourself 

it’s my wife

strutting from the cold 

you can feel the eyes upon you 

adjusting what you feel 

you can tell it doesn’t bother you 

just afraid it won’t last 

in your mind you always seem outnumbered 

I don’t dare make a stand 

wrote the sayings 

mostly praise 

out there in the spotlight 

I am million miles away 

every ounce of energy 

I try to give away 

as the sweat pours out your body 

like the poison dead 

while the rolling thunder 

sends praise 

playing the storm again 

here I am 

there I go

out off the stage 

it is in the mystery 

still they try to see 

why something good 
can hurt so bad 

caught on on the lonely streets 

taste of something bitter sweet 

love will survive somehow someway 

on love feeds the fire 

one love is crying now 

two hearts will beat as one 

your love wonders 

who is crying now 

so many stormy nights 

so many wrong turns right 

need one who can change their righteous ways 

and if the love is brave 

knock another page 

the fire is the one laughing to save 

say 

who will be the lonely one 

wonder 

heed is crying now 

only so many tears you can cry 

till the heart ache is flowing 

and now you can say 

your love will never die 

one love grew who is crying now 

two hearts to find the sound 

on love who is crying now 

I have climbed highest mountain 

I have run through the fields 

only to be with you 

I have run 

I have crawled 

I have scaled these city walls 

only to be with you 

but I still haven’t found 

what I am looking for 

I have kissed hardened lips 

while my feeling hiding fingertips 

we burn like the fire 

this burning desire 

I have spoke with turning angels 

I have held wonderful nights 

I was as cold as the storm 

but I still haven’t found what I am looking for 

I believe in the kingdom come 

bend all the colors 

painting the sun 

read into one 

you brought the thorns 

and you loosened chains 

carry the cross 

of my shame 

you know I believe it 

we can’t be saved if he didn’t sin 

his sin was just so elevated 

it has the potential to teach us sanctification 

the sin of vanity 

solomon 

ecclesiastics 

here carry the cross 

of my shame 

we brought the graves 

of insanity 

we brought the cross 

where we walk 

but I still haven’t found 

what I am looking for 

we brought the cross 

to the foot of the grave 

it’s like the frost 

of insane 

as a modern day psychiatrist 

I believe christ went insane 

from trying not to be vain 

and sacrificed himself 

a real shame 

deep eddy vodka 

from a magical place 

some say we are impossible to enjoy 

masterfully mixed with love 

wild wild wild 

cats on the hill 

see my lyrics are different 
 
I put my soul all up in them 

calm my soul like a villain 

I want to follow where she knows 

I think about it and release it 

she pulls me in enough to make the message 

you take me places that tear up my indecision 

calm my fire as a waterfall 

she says that she is never afraid 

just picture everybody naked 

she really likes to wait 

pulls me in enough to keep me guessing 

maybe I should start confessing 

he is talking about the muse 

the spirit available to any artist 

whoa we have been shaking 

maybe we have been taken 

can’t we remember fake 

she works the night by the harbor 

she was in the stress 

complicate the mess 

your life ain’t gonna be nothing like my life 

I got to grow and fruit 

cause in the hot sticker 

we amaze compare 

now she got a six year old 

trying to keep him in the song 

when she looks in his eyes 

she tells him 

nobody can keep you warm 

putting in that work 

people only throw shade 

on that which shines 

old pull is out 

hot town summer in the city 

music is in the prism 

let a fist cup reason with spittle 

I am here like 

four one life 

I know that you are feeling 

so won’t you 

take clothes off 

I am the secret whine 

take your clothes off 

if you touch me right 

then I might say goodbye 

an average of there thousand drawers off msrp 

edwards pie 

edwards pie 

has leader upon leader 

of human trafficking 

say ahh 

home auto insurance 

caught wisdom in the net 

I want you to die 

don’t know why you are alive 

cause we don’t resume

resurrect 

would you pick up 

got to be right now 

baby go love me right now 

now or never 

I want you to hold me down 

down forever 

say you spoke woken work 

I want you to astound 

draw the line up 

don’t take no time up 

baby you got to decide something 

you are so cold 

cold baby 

you are the cold 

I ordered escargot 

and a snail was crawling on my plate 

was the snail alive 

where you brought it in 

to put it in your place 

let’s assume I was wearing a nice cream colored suit 

shower in the first place 

cause i want you bad 

haven’t you been thinking about it 

cause I want you bad 

yeah I want you baby 

sweaty hands 

like the sweat dripping up on my dirty laundry 

I don’t want to take my time 

we could do this all night 

slow chance 

fastest snails 

that eluded you 

fingertips putting on a show 

want to weaken 

your resolve 

no chance 

that I am leaving here 

without you on me 

waiting of the rhyming secret 

hope the winds of change will pass you by 

crow at the break of dawn 

wait a second 

keep your hands on mine 

won’t admit what I already know 

I have been the best 

now let me go 

wicked in the sauna 

ripping rum and coke 

we spin the most fire 

so stay 

where would you go 

all you have to do is play 

need somebody with some patient 

because you know I got a temper 

meant to keep this cool 

lift the life line 

interrogation 

when push come to shove 

long as you are holding me down 

I am going to do loving you 

you are the type that we got to wait for 

it is like bonnie and clyde just walked in 

and I am gonna tell the ceiling fan what you 

sold me 

she treats him just like non treated her 

I think they are scared because they are waking up 

and they have been trying to sleep 

through some nightmares 

how do you burn a tree in a swamp 

you call it a croc 

because we live in the swamp 

and we can either make the tree good 

and it’s fruit good 

or else make the tree bad 

and it’s fruit bad 

for a tree is known by it’s fruit 

but all things are equally pure 

and a croc 

conviction is the only currency 

and perfection never changes 

so say the opposite of what you mean 

exactly 

purity cannot be fought 

we live in the swamp 

and everything is a croc 

the living word became flesh 

and when you hear singers stutter 

or get tongue tied 

the mystery is being exposed 

as a double edged sword 

one edge is the vinedresser doing his work to prune our vine 

the other edge is for our own use to prune the word 

the worldly words which are designed to enlighten 

because everything that grows is said in the same spirit 

so let’s see what the love songs have to say 

about the way artists come to life 

and meet with new counselors 

in real time 

as we unconsciously sigh 

we acknowledge the sign 

of conviction 

and preserve the mystery of faith 

while we expose our own vulnerability 

and attack with the sword of the spirit 

and so we change the song 

when you see the changes coming 

and they don’t surprise you 

no matter how terrifying 

you will be unafraid of doing the word 

the work that never ends 

utter the word impossible 

with enough conviction 

and the unbeliever will perceive salt 

and light 

so let’s see what the changes have to say 

and turn on 97.1 the river 

any way you can half a man 

and riddle him into the ground 

are you developing allergies 

to truth and fiction 

then you are prime 

throw shade 

on that which shines 

salvia loves the vine 

blessing all shade 

humid environments 

oh pretty doll face 

your pretty eyes 

are just so hard to take 

make me believe 

again 

love is the beginning of all conviction 

shed tear because I am missing you 

still alright to smile 

is it 

there was a time when I thought about you 

there is no doubt you are in my heart now 

said woman take it slow 

it will work itself out fine 

said sugar make is slow 

and we come together fine 

all we need is just a little patience 

said we made it on the scale 

because we would rather be alone 

I could have you right now 

I wait dear 

some time I get so defensive 

it will work outside 

there is one more thing to consider 

said sugar take this time 

cause the light shuts shining bright 

we won’t fake it 

I will never break it 

it is a living word 

so it will regrow 

new parts 

and corners 

a multidimensional sound 

appears as artifice 

and rubric 


for the canceling of our debts 

resurrect the message 

instruct your higher self 

to see through the 

side of your mouth 

speak with a forked tongue 

trying to see 

what signs come round 

and the streets don’t change 

and I ain’t got time for the lead 

it just takes a little patience 

this old free love 

salisbury hill 

at the top of the hour 

I could see the city light 

wind was blowing 

time stood still 

eagle flew out of the night 

he was something to observe 

came in close 

standing stretching 

every node 

had to listen 

had no choice 

I did not believe 

the information 

just had the curse 

made a decision 

heard a voice 

to keep in silence 

I resigned 

my friends would think 

I ate their nuts 

so I went from day to day 

oh my life was in a rut 

till I thought what I would say 

which connection I would cut 

I was part of the scenery 

walked right out of the machinery 

he said grab your boots 

I have come to make you tone 

when illusion is in the net 

and liberty was a broken cord 

no one taught me etiquette 

today I don’t need her replacement 

I told them what the smile on my face 

meant 

I say keep my things 

they came to take me home 

many versions of this song abound 

but at least he acknowledged the mood 

the muse who focused his thought 

an imaginary listener 

keeping calm 

and sighing contentedly 

with conviction 

I got to run to keep on rounding 

and I am bound to keep on proud 

I got one more silver dollar 

but I am not gonna let them catch me now 

I am not gonna let them catch the midnight rider 

I don’t own the clothes I am wearing 

and the road goes on forever 

seducing the muse 

to answer with joy 

please cry out debacle 

with conviction 

save your praise 

for unworthy songs 

I have gone down the point of caring 

so old man 

I sweeten you by sharing 

I am gonna let them catch the midnight rider 

silver sights 

a new truth in a classic light 

old and new 

keep safe 

I want you to want me 

let me help you 

help me help you

when you were young and your heart was an open book 

it used to say live and let live 

it did not 

what if this ever changing world 

that we live in 

makes you give in and cry 

say live and let die 

crimes against humanity 

ambivalent intentional salami

what does it matter to you 

when you got a job to do 

you got to do it well 

you got to give the other man

in you 

and me 

in the radio frequency

I need to hang tough 

and I won’t 

and I will 

and we need 

and I grow 

and I learn 

to love 

like a moving heartbeat 

in a ripped twin hour 

chosen shine 

I am like the driving rain 

you like the restless love 

I got to feel it in my blood 

I need to take and lead your love 

touch 

and I wont’t 

and I need 

and I will 

and I acknowledge the work

see the universe is a material compactor

situations looking for dead weight 

and set aflame 

I got to feel it in my love 

I need your touch 

and need your love 

the opposite is not a mistake 

the corrections are the same 

and I want 

and I need 

and I love 

and I want

slapstick

reaching for the justice 

he was making for the break 

and the trading facts 

in the mustard cyclone 

he got eight good feet 

and the noise he bummed 

was never undone 

why twice he ran away

spirits are using me

what heaven brought you and me 

cannot be forgotten 

I have been around the horn 

globe 

looking for the world 

glove 

when you see the southern cross 

for the first time 

we understand now why 

we came this way 

because the truth you see 

may be too strong 

save it for a dying day 

I have my ship 

and all my flags are flying 

she is all that I have left 

and music is her name 

think about how many times 

interest central 

larger voices calling 

I have been around the world 

looking for the war woman 

the woman girls

and you can feel it 

and you know it will 

oh my you got another minute 

pray for the first time 

it’s a troubled relay 

making sayings for the light 

salty way for the slime 

slugs 

you will survive being bested 

somebody fine will come along 

and forget about loving you 

and the southern cross 

he got bested 

and he raised the stakes 

by trading places with me 

hard rock 

apple 

we pine 

we conclude 

we said you would meet me 

but it’s a quarter to two 

I turn em back and I mess em around 

I think of you every night and day 

you took my heart and you took my pride 

away 

I fell sweaty on the deserted beach 

and I hate myself for loving you 

nice 

we got plans 

we can tell them to you 

you took my heart 

and you took my pride 

today 

I hate myself for loving you

we are going to celebrate 

for loving you 

one more time 

one more time 

rake up laggy 

we got something to say to you 

we got something working 

and it’s a party 

with two 

the holy spirit is the muse 

you led me away from known 

just to save me from freedom 

just to steal my heart 

and that is what really hurts 

the morning sun when it’s in your face 

really shows your age 

I laughed at all of your jokes 

my love you didn’t need to coax 

Oh Maggy I cried all night 

raise the stakes 

all I needed was a friend to guild a guiding hand 

but you turned me into a lover 

all you did was wreck my bed 

and in the morning you kicked me in the head 

oh laggy 

I couldn’t have tried 

you stole me heart 

I wouldn’t need you if I tried 

we kiss our students and send them back to school 

keep this kid honest

why laggy 

I wished I never could see your face 

blind with conviction 

tragedy and triumph 

wrong for conviction 

my heart studios 

i heart radio 

commercials 

programming 

static 

running around throwing that dirt 

cause you know I would pull up 

going around every party 

cause you knew 

I know that treasures 

come up 

what you expect 

I knew from the start 

one of these days 

running around throwing that dirt down 

cause you knew that I could call you up 

where you stare 

he met elvis priestly 

where the fear treads 

you just want attention 

I just want my heart 

courage 

I am just taking control 

would you mind if I looked you over 

let me run with you tonight 

I would take you on a moonlight ride 

there is someone I use to seek 

but she don’t give a damn for me 

well let me get to the point 

let’s roll another craft 

take this long one down 

what book will replace this one 

I know how it feels 

to be real 

people scam 

people score 

some grown young 

some grow old 

I know I caught up in between 

I know this land 

in a dream 

you know I have been taking some time 

keeping to myself 

but your loving hit me harder 

you don’t know how it feels 

to be me 

I am not chasing the round 

sipping bacardi 

you know I love it when the music stopped 

you can strip this down for me 

so put your hands on your party 

and keep the ground 

my old man is paid to rock 

but he is tool old 

think of me what you will 

I have got a little space to fill 

jet 

roll another point 

head on down the road 

there is someone 

I got to grow 

so put your hands on your body 

and strip it down for me 

yeah yeah yeah yeah 

a memory hood sail 

you know I love it 

want the music to stop 

keep this crowd 

in lead 

97.1 the river 

classic rock 

ryan seacrest and sisanee river 

tell me something good 

you know I am falling falling perform 

tender night from my head to my toes 

help me make the feeling grow 

cause when the loving starts and the cameras flash 

you rule me till the sun hat is flat 

I love to take you find me in the studio 

that stress has come up 

off 

undress me with your eyes 

want to say 

that you love me 

cause when the wandering gaze 

alters the third rock from the sun 

you say that you love me 

falling falling falling 

got me thinking back when you were mine 

another song that has lasted an inordinate amount of time 

good night 

charlie puth 

think you can’t work full time 

and complete your college degree 

just a song 

it’s always a shame 

that’s all 

I could say down 

when you say ripe 

you know that’s a cigarette 

that might get your babies pregnant 

why does he always seem to be 

he looking at you 

turning me on 

turning me off 

making me feel like I want too much 

living with you has me putting me through it 

all the time 

buy 

why does he always to seem to be 

looking at you 

it’s the same 

rose that I love you 

there is no fire 

I am trying to pretend 

there is a nobody 

that makes me feel like you do 

you are putting me through it all the same 

I could lead 

but I won’t grow 

making it easier 

I know 

can’t feel a thing 

from my head down to my toes 

so why does he always seem to be 

but I love you 

more than 

there is a no one 

say we will be together till the end 

just as I say this was alright 

tell me it’s black 

when I know that it’s white 

spanish convictions 

there was so much more to catch in that song 

number one love on the brain 

I run for miles got me insane 

it’s got me feeling this way 

well that sound lasted a moment 

if you build we will be around 

field of dreams 

just a chance for me 

a lover 

my friends 

and though there is painting in my church 

I got to wish you the best 

but that don’t mean 

I can get you there 

I pity the fool that falls in love with truth 

well this much is stolen 

got so much in withholdings 

got to check my ticket 

take a train 

why buy the station 

I don’t care where I want to go 

can’t you see 

what that woman 

faster than the shazaam man 

with host jamie fox 

a written record a journal 

that’s all 

I am going to crawl inside and die 

I am leading and I have done enough talking 

I want you to hold me down 

forever 

said shouldn’t I want to keep you around 

you know I should want to keep you around 

laugh me a southbound 

thunder from georgia 

can’t you see 

what that woman lord 

she been doing to me 

if you believe we put a man on the mood 

there is nothing true 

 i heard 

patience is the one lesson 

I never will get tired of failing at 

get it

I heard where women roar 

and men thunder 

and it sounded like 

the land of lake 

the lake of fire where men thunder 

and I heard so you want to be a big shot 

did you have to open up your mouth 

a song for my mother 

and then lips like sugar 

a perfect example of seducing the muse 

we are reading from the same script 

the secular and religious alike 

in the spiritual economy 

we all rise and fall 

by the same laws

patience and anger 

see the men with the lonely eyes 

make his mind up 

he will be surprised 

all you have to do is stay 

yeah 

take a minute 

take a time 

the clock is ticking 

wait a second 

give a little hand 

self effacing grace 

the light that shone so break 

it’s shadow was full of lies 

like kevin magnum 

left your hand in control of slow hands 

lie answers 

head and heart 

I was studying abroad in italy 

when out at night in a public space 

a forest park party 

there was an italian singer 

but I could understand him 

he was speaking english 

though he said the same thing over and over again 

remember don’t forget 

with an accent 

and it made me remember how easy it is to forget 

when you remember what you are supposed to 

the spiritual economy of conviction 

as if those who don’t get their beauty rest 

would understand 

that language can elevate a heart and mind 

one spirit 

work for the minds relief 

shadow seeds daylight into right 

far from receiving 

but don’t hesitate 

because your love 

won’t wait 

ew baby I love your weight 

want to tell you I love your way 

night and day 

wooden deeds secret 

described 

I wonder how they happen 

and how they shine 

I can see them 

I am conceited 

but don’t hesitate 

because your love won’t wait 

stupid is now next to I love you 

you know my bad dreams smell like me 

like we called it down at the saloon 

mercy and truth 

when you are so conflicted that yes means maybe and no 

heaven is going to be better than all your dreams on earth 

that is why everything is equally true 

all perfect imitations of an imperfect truth 

illusions that we plant as seeds in the perfect mind of god 

we seed out lies with imperfect recollections of a perfect truth 

you can’t trust your eyes 

we are born in the flesh 

and we recount for ourselves 

the perfect lives which we have never seen 

it is insightful 

but I think you will find it funny and irreverent 

like an inside joke that makes you cry tears of joy 

the stock is tricky 

tracking wacky plastic 

stock and trade 

give me some praise 

daddy was a johnnie go hard 

jena dreams of running away 

baby it’s okay 

so tough 

break out each other 

and thet is a lot 

we make it hot 

oh living on prayer 

take me hand 

we will make it 

I swear 

we got to hold on 

ready or not 

you live for the fire 

that is all that it’s got 

two parts patience 

one part anger 

the proper answer to jealousy 

for the spirit that is in us 

yearns jealously 

up down funk 

you are going to be starting something 

someone is always crying 

got my baby dying 

watch you high 

get over 

too low 

get under 

if you are stuck in the middle 

the the lame is a syllable 

and when the dad made the baby 

then go have a baby 

you want to be high 

then get over 

you want to be low 

then get over 

cause the same sounds 

made sound pure 

I am gonna say I am on a side of a mountain side 

I was saved on the side of a mountain top 

phonemes 

well you done me 

I thought the weight through the cracks 

before the pull run out 

I give my best 

I reckon it taking my turn 

open up your eyes and see like me 

open up your plans and be a riddle 

it is our god forsaken right 

to be loved 

you look good 

I will lie 

now better men than me have failed

drinking from that holy grail 

I am not sure you will make somebodies night 

but I assure you 

you sure as hell made mine 

I got to pick you up 

dude 

signing out 

cruise 

why 

I just died in your arms tonight 

it must have been something you said 

I came looking for something jet black 

broken hearts all around me 

now I don’t see a way to get out 

I run through my hands in hair 

I just died in your arms tonight 

it must have been something you said 

it must have been some kind of kiss 

I should have walked away 

greetings loved ones 

let’s take their chair 

I know a place 

where the grass is really greener 

warm wet and wild 

where the sought after is dialed 

you can travel the world 

but nothing comes close 

to the golden girls 

fine fresh pierced 

we got it on lock 

sex on the beach 

we drew a step 

out of setting 

wet center 

califronia girls 

we are unforgettable 

daisy dukes 

bikini on top 

sun kissed skin 

we wet your popsicle 

the girl is a freak 

you drop it cheep 

right right 

turn off the lights 

we got too much to do 

party crasher 

panty snatcher 

mash this up if your a dancer 

so raise your glass if you are wrong 

the litter strewn nude beach 

so brace yourself if you are right 

on the other waves 

we will never be anything but loud 

nitty gritty dirty freaks 

so if you are school child age 

and you treat me like a fool 

we can always party 

lost in a dream 

I don’t know which 

way to grow 

you are all that you see 

but baby I am moving way too slow 

I have been fooled before 

would I like 

to get my love 

cut in the slamming door 

teach the teachers 

or are you just having fun 

times standing still 

waiting for some 

small clue 

I keep getting chills 


when I think your love is true 

I get fooled 

would I like 

to get my love caught 

in the smaller door 

straight up 

now tell me is it gonna me 

and hip together 

hidden love 

sudden club 

right now 

are we going down 

in flames 

straight up now tell me 

are we gonna run 

my mom tells me to be brave 

but she doesn’t like me crossing lines 

it is harder to be a man 

left up to fate 

I am made from a broom 

that can go to space 

because I am happy 

clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth 

clap along if you know what happiness gives to you 

here come bad news talking this and that 

give me what you want 

and I can hold it back 

can’t nothing bring me down 

your love is too high 

I said I will tell you now 

your love is too high 

can’t nothing make me wild 

shoot the feelings in the face 

sleep on items of weird movement 

rap the wisdom of crafty secrets 

tap into new dimensions 

hate the player hate the game 

snap along 

if you feel like a room without a roof 

clap along if you know what happiness 

is on you 

adjust what you want to do 

will your map still remember the taste of my love 

got to love you 

till we are seventy 

baby my heart 

could still fill us apart 

at seventy 

place your hands on our beating heart 

when all I am hearing 

is under cooked 

and mention is sick 

because baby your soul 

could never grow old 

it’s ever green 

baby your smile 

it is in my mind 

in memory 

I am thinking about 

how people fall in love in mysterious ways 

maybe it’s all part of the plan 

I will just keep on making the same 

mistakes 

hoping it’s all part of the plan

I will keep it high 

big out 

owl love 

making owl love 

keep me out of it 

the way to your heart 

mirror suspicions 

every breath you take 

every move you make 

every bond you break 

every step you take 

I will be watching you 

every single day 

any game you play 

every way 

oh can’t you see 

you belong to me 

now my poor heart aches 

every step you take 

every smile you fake 

even when I am not mad about it 

I deem it now 

but I see your face 

I feel so bold 

and I long for your embrace 

the passion you see 

what belongs to me 

every vow you forsake 

every rush you take 

I will be washing you 

let me be at the control panel 

versa chi on the floor 

I throw my hair upon the air 

light up this club 

like the right man 

motivation for the span 

king 

I set my mind up 

just to dream 

I am the one 

and mother always told me 

be careful who you love 

be careful you you slum 

digital artifacts 

the kid is not my son 

choose the lesser one 

later 

life in the mansion 

we stab it with our steely knowledge 

but we just can’t keep the muse 

eyes like mine 

would you dance 

on the floor 

in the round 

people always told me 

be careful who you found 

billy jean is not my lover 

she is just the girl 

that claimed 

I am the one 

the kid is not my son 

the champion slum 

enjoy the power 

chad is not my son 

now billy jean 

is not my lover 

she is just a queen 

slapping me with a restraining order 

you know you did 

completely lost 

it is too hard 

to sleep 

I got good sheep at the door 

flee 

I tape the driver 

out the door 

I got it fast 

girl you don’t want 

I want to want me 

there is nothing I won’t do 

the lower hanging fruit leads 

play multiple stations 

old and new 

and everything in between 

three is the optimal number 

the legends out of juice 

spiderman’s control 

and batman in a fix 

it’s made 

girl you don’t want 

I want you want me 

there is nothing now 

I would do 

to get up next to you 

I know your inside is feeling so hollow 

and it’s a hard pill 

if I fall for you 

I will never recover 

I nearly want to love somebody 

I really want to touch somebody 

I think about you every single day 

but you can take me to the fray 

you are such a hard act for me to follow 

love me today 

don’t leave me tomorrow 

will I fall for you 

I will never be the same 

I won’t know where to stop 

I am more than a little lost 

I don’t know what to do 

asking what 

where do I stay tonight 

the son of man has nowhere to lead his sheep 

we are making a new 

higher heaven 

starting with an apology from my friend

text message history off Facebook messenger 

sorry man I had a bit of my spine cut out a few years ago 

the pain makes communication uncomfortable 

I am working on it now 


two spaces means a change of speaker 


sorry the knight has made it clear our energy is stalking something 

and that something may be this which he told me to tell you 

when fame finds us it will cancel our gets and burn us in the residue 

And I have a good idea what my next steps are 

So I would be happy to let you shape the dialogue 

Like a christian 

Lead before I follow 

Please believe in the magic 

I am bound 

in a song that hasn’t been played yet 

it is cheaper than drugs 

Our pineal is manufacturing fifteen grams of dat

Where the eleven can find out what we are made of 

like an adjustment from the quack 

I was at school and the preacher told me you are fine 


Good you know I never really mentioned james 

Yea, I am a descendent of the great hunter.  You know this man? 


The people who don’t notice the changes 


They can’t 


Are already on all levels 


Their perception is controlled and that’s what causes the change 


We are less than ordinary 

But you can only go so far south 


I go as deep as I have to to find what we need 


What kind of memes did you trap in HI 

I am glad to hear you never mentioned James 

The knight has found me 

And I am watching him wake up my friends 


None, we also are an inter-dimensional creature although most don’t sense it.  Best I can tell we create the world they live in 


Higher heavens 


Ice just begun building homes I suppose if I will 

I’ve not ice, but funny 


Immigration 

Ha 

All roads lead back to us 

It is not in vain 


I know, I am aware 


Fit slips are adjusting my world view 


Have to fight vanity tho, it’s a consciousness entity that attacks this position specific 


I have strong holds up against it 

coffee house version of u2


The last physical manifestation I saw here was Narcissus.  I lives in the web we have created for it 


Echo made man god 

Look at me 


It has a way of making one thinking it’s that, that’s what all them do 


are we it 


Make you think you are something your not 

usually them 


So it is a battle between that and them


No just old fashioned humans being upgraded so we can deal with this new threat 

MMMM, battle is a strong word.  Every thing wants to survive 


The battle is the war 


Of sorts 


I met a gazelle and it’s hunter 

I got to be a witness 


Interesting Bree’s 

Breed 


Yes 


Sure, witness a lot 


Like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter 

The spiritual economy is now married to the material economy 

There is a point where all life comes to an end 


That’s kinda what the pentagram represent 

The Star of David can be divided into individual parts 


I want to open a theater 

That shows flics like the da vimici code 

I have seen it on a rozeor blade that was actually a key 


And to answer your earlier question< I gather a great deal more than memes.  A lot more 


Fine 

To a hyper dimensional space ship 

Complete thoughts 

That is what you collect 


complete thoughts is what I assemble 

trap door 


What do you mean? 


Playing on the radio


Oh, your observing synchronicity


I know as much as humanly possible about thought assembly 

I have got three radio stations on 

I have two on the internet 

And one on the phone 


Well see about that 


Got to stay sharp 


There’s more to it than just the exterior control of others 


The vine dresser is coming 

The sword of the spirit is our only hope 

a bountiful harvest 

I will let you read my new book 


I’m sure.  I will.  A harvest of what? 

And for what purpose? 


I would ask what we are waking up for 

But the answer is to dream 


Good way to put it 


The harvest is the pineal 

it’s our crop yet we don’t get to harvest it


Being the harvest and winning souls 

are the same thing 


I don’t know I’m not so sure winning souls aren’t ripe fruit ready for consumption 


We agree 


I’ve been carving a different path 


Where does the harvest grow 


In a separate dimension 

we are the roots of tree and vine 


maybe we can unite in megiddo 


I believe it to be the fish or the sith, it would have to be close.  

Unless it’s in the thirteenth 


I can remember talking to you about things we haven’t talked about 


This is Megiddo, it’s just not recognizable 


In the physical 

Perfect

I am nimrod 


no your not that is just what everyone 

That was thrown into the temple thinks 


It has already happened 

We are in the exterior 


We are descends of Nimrod the great hunter. genius, prophet 

This is the line of judah 


We are in the jungle the swamp the ghetto the slum 


That is what Nimrod means, great hunter,  I am sure you known that too


I think I made it happen tonight 


What may 


I walked through a spider web tonight 

I officially made the new now 


have you turned on a  radio 


The spirit likes me because I have a thing for specifics and riddle breaking.  And parable making, so to relate the quantum world to this one.  I like specifics.

No bowie

I don’t even own a radio 

I d like a ham radio tho i’ve heard some wild things on those 


The new now is all around 

number stations and stuff 


The riddle is the new now 

and it’s evolving 


Cosmic noise 


All that matters is here and now 

07.1 96.1 103.7


Those look like coordinates 

Radio stations yea those are the ones 


we are here 

only one melting miracle can keep us away from the kids 


What’s your ideas on that. 


We must grow new fruit 

legacy is eternal 

the hook is evolving 

I can tell you how I am assembled 


If you can 


And you can tell me the same thing about yourself 

Therefor together we may assemble new homes 

migraines raise focus 

laser light collapses the foreground 


no can its’ the most guarded secret of all 


till the foreground becomes the background 

I am letting it out 

one page at a time 


it’s real easy to do it wrong 

look at the massive suffering in this world 


there is a filter on a nicrom old fashioned camera 

the microfilm we live on 


now we are talking 


and you and I are focusing lasers by and by 


well most people think they are stars but whatever laser works 


the headache you endure resembles the star light 


I am a star incarnate here on earth.  stars are the supercomputers of the cosmos 


my girl friend thinks I am sexy when I smoke a cig 


and here we make consciousness into new stars 

Good to know 


She showed me the door of chapel perilous 

it is the black pupil that attracts her 

reflecting star light 

you have the same original void 

great hunter 


yes sir 

the void

it was only you and me 

making for the younger years 

but we have been down that road before 

is it too hard to see we are in heaven 

Synch

they are finding us in the matriz

but where will we wake up 

at least our flash life lies 

this sunday 

Dacid

Should be part of this 

he believes in less seed 

or did I say more seed 

so I woke up in a science fiction nobel 

and the data demanded answers 

too high get over 

too low get under 

and the pain is tender 

dark my baby 

crime 

garden

frame rate 

you are reeling me in 

still saying the sub

while blacks slant eyes 

spanish harlem 

your a vegetable 

alien 

I have got to extract the data 

your a hacker 

inform reason 

genetic phenotype 
that corner got tighter 

stop that god dog crime 

two became one 

three tetragrams 

I am the saying on the top of a mountain top 

I am the saying 

I wassailed on the sign of a mountain top 

I was saved on the sound of a mountain top 

shall we crawl through the jungle 

I will meet you in the valley 

Love 

Allergic to buds 

we make avitue into one vice of a season 

as we round the corners 

merry go round 

sweet misery 

then I went to bed and woke up to find this 


You have not changed 

this is all really funny to me now that I have some more puzzle pieces 

but even that has changed 

when I looked at it earlier he said the same things backwards 


let me know what the aeon looks like 

lower voices have more seeds 

I am a bud falling into a bush 

as I walk 

to my machine 

do you realize I exposed my fresh scenery 

the night we met again 

as did you 

both nights but you were more raw the second one 

we must be moving opposite directions in time 

will you come 

then we will go to the old one last 

I am going to a new church this sunday 

Chapel perilous 

Roberto Anto Wilsin

will you sin to save a life 

even if it might be your own 

that was the decision you made before you were born 

I know heaven wants to steal you soul 

but I suspect you want to take it slow 

we memorize don’t wait 

to shake me 

just want to feel it from you 

don’t be afraid to catch feels 

I read top red to top real 

sorry back to your regularly scheduled programming 

working too hard to give you a heart attack 

you were in toddler clothes when I am a shark 

sergeant bleary is walking the bleat 

what parts in a medical sender 

lift the keep back 

program full stack 

moms if that is moving out 

then I am moving out 

felt him actually move 

up 

you should never argue with a crazy man 

you can hang on the sound 

watch this over time 

if that is what you get for your money 

if that is what have on your mind 

good luck 

cause I am moving out 

i think about her and she knows it 

I want to let her take control 

she pulls me in enough to keep me guessing 

maybe I could stop and start confessing 

I love it when you stop 

you go crazy 

manipulate my decisions 

ever girl crazy about a shark last name 

love white 

my name 

I am not listening to a single thing 

when my mind stops coming 

I am going to reel you in 

confessing 

you take all my inhibitions 

you take me places 

we tear up the reputation 

if we lost our minds 

and we took it way too far 

I know we would be alright 

if I was by mysids

and we stumbled in the dark 

oh I have been shaking 

you take me places 

manipulate my decision 

they come running just as fast as they can 

and back to your regularly scheduled programming 

me 

craft luck silly goos now try and tell me my train isn’t trailing it’s caboose 

long as you hold me down 

ground control to major tom 

atlantas classic rock library 

97.1 

looks like bonnie and clyde just walked in 

and I am going to hear the ground 

swell 

stolen 

that is why we widen game 

on the flow seat 

crown 

you have a lower voice than me 

that is why I am pollinating your buds 
keep em trimmed 

have you seen theocrat come up out of the stars and snatch a child 

don’t be ceciving 

I trust my feelings 

Mind control is real and it is healing us 

we are no longer in the jungle 

I didn’t want to be stuck in heaven 

so I made this endlessly creative 

all the light shining would wake up at the same time 

with your pollen and my bush 

we are incriminating the wisdom 

34A

three is circumference 

four is diameter 

and there is one curve 

a point 

pi 

pi r squared 

circumference divided by diameter 

come and move in that thankful direction 

turn every situation in to having 

ever sun rise 

on my dark days 

fit me love 

tell me how to put it on 

baby take it slow 

we can last 

a prism of secluded twilight 

a jungle in the risen fire 

would you care for a smoke 

we are all mad here 

control your anger 

when the magic roasts 

the consideration is undone 

and the final final is wicked 

but we are making a sanctified rarity 

the last child to dance in eternity 

infinity 

aeon 

we are in a big machine 

I think we are in the matrix 

if you want to blame something 

for my unbecoming 

blame the computer 

you got to go through sadness to know mercy 

shame and silence are partners with patience 

passion is for the sunday mornings 

laid a pill 

too many crimes 

we got fine whine 

loving this station 

one in one 

two in two 

oh the song said 

fool the party with style 

and I know you can hear me play 

but we can’t keep the night 

I am closed

shop open 

satisfaction 

baby 

we are the teams that come off the cheap seats 

we are chasing thrills 

we are giving me chills 

I know I am better I know you can hear it 

I sit at the table 

we got compassion 

attraction 

we got some new shoes 

and five dollar cigs 

four 

two 

one 

got my attention 

let me give you the satisfaction 

keep calming attention 

got another good try 

i feed it memes and it spoon feeds me dreams 

move your self 

you are always thinking 

win or loser 

you are the spanish fly 

shake yourself 

you are every move you make 

so the story goes 

owner of lonely heart 

owner of a broken heart 

say you got to chance it 

looking up for the car 

what designs you got on the bar 

raisin steaks 

the steaks were the race of cattle who fed off the raisins 

via humans 

I was at a racetrack no a qt in macula at the intersection of hamilton mill and 124 

and there were flashing busses in the night like a government cordon 

old fashioned scary military busses painted black 

and I had to equalize the tone 

and help them hold 

we might have prevented a premature rapture 

I was at a racetrack not qt 

and the guy didn’t draw on me will you show id 

before I drew on him 

I will show you id 

and the jp morgan rep stepped in and said that is your time 

like he was angry with the guy for not giving me a better deal he printed a coupon from a portable coupon printer behind the counter and out of sight

and I save seven thirty eight 

the rapture is here 

but what will we do when the world disappears 

I could give a thousand reasons why 

where you are growing 

and everyone knows 

it 

is dangerous 

the tale of the crazy raisins 

involves the few that are crazy enough 

to not be made into wine 

because they follow the teachings of the great old raisin 

who lives on the great mountain 

but there is a force working against them 

dry 

and the only think keeping them young and vibrant is music 


and they have got to travel to the great mountain 

to remember or learn the secrets of all the songs 

old and new 

because truth never changes 

going going around 

throwing that dirt on my mind 

because you knew that I would be about it 


praying at the feet of a master 

I am just like the raisin 

and the master is a ghost 

and the ghost is in the machine 

and the master is neo 

and he is translating the source code of reality 

till the choices are plain 

and we repeat the same lessons enough 

to transpire 

what lessons are you learning 

so I am sorry if what I am writing 

only comes out like a slow trickle of information 

believe me we all wish it could happen faster 

I feed it memes and it spares me from the drams 

or it feeds me memes and put s me to sleep 

perfect opposites the only way to escape the static 

my mom says I dart my eyes 

and then she got in a wreck last night 

because a car that looked grey in the dark on grey pavement 

came out of nowhere and may have totaled her car 

I wish she could have learned how to dart her eyes 

snip snip cut 

some they do 

some the don’t 

and some it’s just as well 

you can be proud of your behavior 

without being vain 

goodbye stranger 

it’s been nice 

hope you die 

goodbye mary 

goodbye to me 

feel no sorrow 

feel no shame 

come to morrow 

feel no pain 

slow hands 

like sweat dripping down my dirty laundry 


there is a law that you have to have the spirit of the song or program on tv 

to even speak during a program 

so everything said under the influence 

of either 

reflects both 


no chance that I will be leaving here without you 

want me 

bigger tips 

putting on a show 

can you tell that I want you baby 

no chance that I am leaving here without you 

obviously 

won’t be love 

it’s the end of the world 

as we know it 

and I feel fine 

time 

pardon the rhyme 

she got eyes of the bluest skies 

and a champaign bottle too 

she got a smile that seems to me 

reminds me of childhood memories 

where everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky 

now and then 

when I see her face 

she takes me away 

to a special place 

and if I stay there too long 

I will probably break down and cry 

she got eyes of the bluest skies 

and an ounce of sour brave 

and pray for the thunder and the rain 

to quiet me past my bedtime 

where do we go 

to the post position 

the flip sip prism 

it worked because I didn’t want to leave his web unanswered 

she says it is cold outside and she hands me my raincoat 

she is always worried about things like that 

she said it is all going to end and it might as well be my fault 

but she only sleeps when it’s raining 

and she screams and her voice is straining 

and it is all going to be scared sometimes 

she has got a little bit of something 

god it is better than nothing 

and in her color portrait world 

she has got it all 

she doesn’t style quite as far as she use to 

she believes that life isn’t made up of all it is used to 

she believes that happiness is a matt that sits on her doorway 

she says baby 

it’s 3am and I must be lonely 

and I can’t help to be scared 

of it all sometimes 

I love my car 

five star ghost 

above and beyond 

go straight down your tracks 

you could have an airplane flying 

with a quarter ounce of mushrooms 

you could have a big dipper 

you could have a thumping car thumping 

and the music never ends

roving around your fruit cakes 

because I will be sure honey bee 

like the fire starter 

fame combiner 

you got to call sledge hammer 

fix your mind at rest

I feel like I can see these artists 

struggling in a hyper dimensional 

chamber where they have to  make the hook sick 

before they can get out 

and all the people who ever sang along 

or will ever sing along 

are in there helping them 

running from mine 

I fit inside the wandering life 

it fits so easy 

I know I am loose 

I like running in sand 

barefoot 

get over here 

can’t stop the pole 

can’t fight the pole 

it’s out of sink 

the voice of reason 

it hates to laugh 

so far behind 

can’t stop the fields 

where would I go 

can’t stop the hold 

it’s like the hold 

it’s out of synch 

won’t let it die 

oh oh oh 

some one like you 

somebody 

someone like you 

I been roaming around 

I was looking down at all I see 

getting in the cove or the den 

or the dome 

is a matter of looking down 

all pretty ladies from around the world 

we got a weird kind of prism 

and we love to get loud 

wave your hands in the air like you don’t care 

we watch the worth 

word up 

when you feel the call 

you got to get it under way 

word up 

no matter where you say it 

you will be heard 

try to put on real fast 

and you don’t realize 

you are acting like fools 

we don’t have the time for psychological romance 

moms tell me what is the word 

should I stay or should I go 

if I say that you are mine 

I will be there till the end of time 

so you have got to let me know 

If I should stay or should I go 

a wild child 

swift and cold 

shape shift rip strip 

I want you to hold me down 

my best is 

you want to keep me around 

paradise 

when she was just a girl 

she expected the world 

but if flew away from her reach 

so she ran away in a dream 

and dreamed of paradise 

every time she closed her eyes 

pine tree trigger sweaty sap 

and the bullets catch in her teeth 

life goes on it gets so heavy 

every tear a water fall 

in the night the stormy night she closed her eyes 

in the night the stormy night away she flies 

and dreamed of 

paradise 

so lying underneath a stormy sky 

she said I know the sun will set to rise 

this could be paradise

I entered a lucid dream when Kerry kept texting me the wub

he really only sent it once but based on when I needed it I got that one 

at different times 

and because I was also awake 

the evidence of our conversation is preserved 

the key to interpretation is thinking about the last thing on your mind 

not the first thing you think was said 

and here is some poetry designed to make you more readily read from the back of your hand 

a safe distance to above 

the green grinch of kittens 

waiting for the monster of years 

grown from the seams of searching 

wandering hostess modern moles 

sought fortune at the drink 

bitter green they called me 

waiting for the sunken pond 

waiting on no one 

to thank her son 

better dream they called her 

bitter grill we followed 

waiting for some hunk 

hunches on that cluster 

cluing out the foundry 

if you could read my mind girl 

like an old glass storm door 

stare straight ahead and read the story 

of a change on my scene 

know I am not a history 

as long as I am closed 

we can’t think 

the heart aches for heroes 

failed monks of renown 

read that book 

and muggle debate 

I work on the way 

like a movie star on engines 

number two works for keeps 

consideration ripped from deliverance 

freezing moments closer 

traffic coaster causes grope 

rush hour slow mind 

something like a lake 

I know where we went wrong 

the feeling is gone 

and the monks can’t 

racking up carnage 

beneath the blue bellied whale 

barnacles for hire 

sighting in the harpoon

with his love we will type 

casting corn for bate 

pretending it ends 

and it’s the sword we have found 

she will wonder why 

sighed the whole day long 

dewey eyes for closure 

there was no knew fissure 

on with the honest signs of life 

tell the markets we wrote off advice 

and if the sword 

endowed you would wonder why we tried 

the whole day blown 

leaking down through the fields of grain 

on the softer life like sighs 

we prayed all night 

and where the robber obeyed 

the wasted chance 


some dreams we want to scare us 

while the forrest welcomes us 

it still feels like a sin 

when the thorns mention skin 

losing the dusty floor 

to the heavy sweep 

neuro linguistic programming 

brooms full of cheap lint 

hard loving candles flame out 

stained glass rub a strand 

of ivory heat in the theater

There was a time 

when this far lung 

wired the mystic waters 

found alone against the sun 

along the dark foreboding 

when the green dark silence 

was fought with to be real 

as green the most calming 

where the mind filled the factory 

for the good of us all 

a man who beat his head against the system 

and when the young man spoke 

for the healing hammers ring 

their minds were unfocused 

their minds were undone 

for the listening frank steer 

raiding the goose for the upper hand 

look away sad babe 

from the eastern mortuary 

she ruggedly sat down 

let the life blood flow

dream up the workers 

leading ankles 

sand 

got on our way 

because we are rioting with the float 

behind blue robin 

the solvents new soul 

the white baby soft 

where salt unwrought the table 

we are now unhappy 

to worry on the rocky pathway 

living on drunken stew 

shoe brackets hold on 

old grandmas we are 

working up on the rain 

the shifting conditions render

a prism of fitting supposition 

sudden without recompense 

one final was harkening 

can you follow the bouncing ball 

infinite jest

swinging our hammers

burned nose hair 

in the water 

meek thrill 

shivering worthless clocks 

stalkings still need speech 

chapters all supporting 

sport the dusky musk 

shell fish 

disheveled 

and mystery keeping speed 

with my pace 

to the channel 

away 

we make haste after 

flume 

naked winds and corners 

where morgues work string 

strength and the knocking wind of gripe 


how is the spin pass 

got any fish casting wands 

four fresh daft punks 

let the dead crown 

piss on the special holiday 

encourage misfits 

radical selfless 

spirits 


now sweep me off my feet 

and embrace me 

with intangibility 

I need your sheltering calm 

someone to understand the triumph 

deeply touched 

humanity 

thank you baby 

I closed my eyes tonight 

everything you did was just a bore 

you had it out for me 

and my rhythm seeks 

more control 

and your heart beat helps me take hold 

of the inconsiderate drama we relate 

with the useful deals 

of fruitless hippies 

like the bees 

finding honey 

the sign so sweet 

with song singing low 

baby is hungry 

and the book bag 

won’t coordinate my lock 

down in mexico 

where the emotions 

a real symbol of in touch 

fire just withholding more light 

in the early morning rain 

and the forrest full of sanity 

well my collar is full of gold 

in the order

rising grave 

while the motors listening 

fast 

now the liquor tastes good 

and the moment is as good as possible 

hear the roar of the silvery sights 

either way we are west

word fine 

where the morning border she calms 

and the sun will be found 

the old airport has gotten me 

drowned 

in the murk of sad and gloomy 

drunkeness 

stop and stare 

at her waves 

my hat is gone 

what did you get 

force loving dreams 

caught moving in my 

stalling trade 

Won’t think of you 

when I am gone 

wait on the love you thought 

I would be 

I’ve got a hundred 

fruit like joy 

explain the wisdom 

spent 

and respect the hardest love 

to fetch 

what can you perceive

no triggers 

what baby 

you try to give me your money 

you better save up babe 

save it for your rainy day 

I ain’t gonna hurt you baby 

awe yeah 

that is jimmy talking 

romantics 

please trigger me 

when you close your eyes 

and you go to sleep 

and it’s down to the sound of a heartbeat 

and you hear the things that you are dreaming about 

when you open up your heart 

and the truth comes out 

you tell me that you want me 

you tell me that you need me 

you tell me that you love me 

and I know I am right 

cause I hear it in the night 

I hear the secrets that you keep 

when you are talking 

when I hold you in my arms at night 

don’t you know you are in the spotlight 

and all of your dreams that you keep inside 

you just can’t imprison 

everything about you is a mystery 

contradiction 

if I were blind 

I would be blown away by my radio 

especially when more than one song is playing 

oh baby I am in fear for my life 

law man has put an end to my life 

oh mama I can hear you crying 

you are so scared and all alone 

hang man is coming down from the gallows 

and I don’t have very long 

when we pray 

who mom I been here on the lamb 

and a high price on my head 

dear mama I can here you crying so scared and all alone 

the cheek is up 

the new is now 

the renegade that had it made 

and the cheap song 

about me 

you don’t want to know what happened yesterday 

the long arm of the law 

fear for my life 

the chink is up 

the news is out 

they finally found me 

the renegade that had it made 

and the three corner bounty 

the sneak is sound 

the news is out 

they finally found me 

what prudence cowers 

in the heat of a powder 

gun feast 

that song had triggers I couldn’t find 

so I made one up 

shooting at the walls of heartache 

I am the warrior 

heart to heart you win 

if you survive the warrior 

oh baby 

well there is a light in your eye

keep shining 

like the silent can wait 
for a night 

when the silence you describe 

skips prouder 

and if you promise me love so completely 

and you swear that you will always be true 

and you thought it would have a corner 

where you are upset 

I am feeling blue 

now I will stand in the rain on the corner 

I watch the people go shuffling down down 

nothing can mean so prove 

nothing can turn it around 

let live the love that I found 

I think I am being used by a song gypsy 

and the sound is wired up to my internet 

which is being modulated by my heart beat 

and my sound is getting to better 

and my riddles are going to pop 

bubble 

valerian 

that one said you couldn’t turn it around 

because profound no matter what 

truth lens you use to look through it at 
is still profound 

look at him work 

look at him kick 

makes you wonder how the other half lives 

here come the world 

look in it’s eye 

future uncertain but certainly slight 

look at the faces look at the bells 

it’s hard to believe we need a place called hell 

the devil inside 

just writing what I hear 

talking about hell being on earth 

here comes a woman 

look in her eye 

she is fleshed on leather 

fleshed on lines 

words are weapons 

sharper than knives 

makes you wonder 

how the other half died 

every single one of us 

the devil inside 

working to trim the bush of the muse 

he likes her shaven 

words are weapons 

sharper than knives 

no triggers 

who are you 

all trigger 

memory keeper 

who are you 

alice 

I woke up in a swollen popes homes 

he said you can silence my cat 

he said you can reason with the underground 

just get out of my hair 

children who are you 

I took the tube back out of town 

back to the roman den 

I called on passion 

with a wave of my hand 

you can skip the debate 

we can’t skip the debate 

profound 

opposites 

that mean the same thing 

at least one trigger 

who are you 

run swimming find the hold out 

keep skipping we need a cold shower 

I am the simple sad chump 

I know there is a place you walk 

where good words travel in leaves 

sit on the wind 

by the Super Bowl 

and still receive the key 

I sit on my old fast cat 

and still the situation rips 

old music has the best messages 

the only thing that plays with consciousness 

is the bible 

and it’s everywhere 

we don’t have to be afraid of learning lessons 

it’s everywhere 

where is it 

one question away

so be careful what you ask for 

heavenly fire is still hot 

and the only thing that purifies 

hold tight 

we are in for a bumpy ride 

hello and welcome to the alien adventures 

of finn caspian 

finn felt like he could barely see the monster 

it was so huge 

the fake matted fur of his legs 

and the tail with eyes 

commercials can be good 

but I know they do it when the rising tide turns 

gypsy spirit 

colony of derision 

what mania awaits us 

from without side the prism 

Love will cheer the secret song 

don’t fear the reaper 

take my hand 

any fly away 

you are gonna hear a man 

could music hear the fall of sound 

you know I am fit inside a testing ground 

Hey kids love to the baby 

these shrines fell before they sung along 

how many headaches will it take to break through 

until you rat out the pack of zack’s 

she has got an irregular stack of rendering 

benny 

Isaiah 53 suggests we hid our face from christ because he was ugly 

and when we see him there is no beauty that we should desire him 

and we hid as it were our faces from him 

modern language 

you are my disability 

I have had a major disruption 

and it may be a miscommunication 

when bob said that calling vita had something to do with calling probation 

them calling probation 

I thought you were trying to get me to hit bottom again 

I like going over to her house because when I am with her 

I feel alone 

with the impetus for creation 

and by the same turn 

I know we will have a genuine conversation 

kerry is helping court get out 

I am watching the gambler 

and I swear that is what my mom wants 

to emasculate me and take pleasure in doing it 

why she has left me alone recently I don’t know 

maybe she realized she was sapping my feminine mind 

territorial issues 

a journal is as good as gold 

kerry knows that christ is the oppressor 

and that he gets singled out by him a lot 

then he rationalized it 

as a non interference 

I think christ is turning up the heat 

on our cultural waking dream 

so that dreaming or being original 

is getting harder 

consequently so is living 

his way of getting us to rely on him 

are you doing this because you want to push the envelope 

or are you working to unwrinkled it first 

because that is mandatory 

I am certain we are being traded 

as social security numbers on a stock exchange 

funded by hot shot stock brokers 

mentally ill people are just the penny stocks 

one might be a genius and one might be a serial killer 

oddballs unite 

the genius may also be abler to tell yo how to get rid of the serial killers 

that is why the values of oddballs are wildly fluctuating 

there are certain people 

which we know 

must die a brave death 

I wish my dad would have told me 

you don’t know what money really is yet 

when I was a young boy 

he told me power corrupts 

and absolute power corrupts absolutely 

and that money shows you who you really are 

what is your view on jail 

because I have gone in and come out a winner 

three times 

isolating a mentally ill person 

shows you what they truly are 

and yet some can’t stand it 

who are you 

it’s like the mentally ill person who can genially remove serial killers from the population 

rubs up karmically with the value of a serial killer 

because they are entangled 

and therefore their personalities are volatile 

or the nice way to put it is quirky 

the correct word is cranky 

crank 

guns are only half measures if you can effectively haunt somebody 

that can be taken many different ways 

all of which are valid 

and underscore the point 

self consciousness is hell 

she could have put me in front of the tv at the lodge in omaha 

that night 

like she did in the morning 

when the preacher came out of left field 

right field 

and dead center 

technology should always be an option 

not an addiction 

but in any situation 

this document is designed 

to show you you have options 

as someone who has been stuck in a song 

I know 

or maybe still is 

when you are a super organism 

all you can see it options and roadblocks 

no paranoia

they are out to get you 

that is how you now know you are stuck in a song 

you feel painfully exceptionally alone 

with the age of aquarius upon us 

women now have the power to make or break a man 

thet is why men are said to need to lead 

and women must set the example 

the place that good songs go to die 

is the same place they are remade 

to be unconscious is to stay in superposition 

and consciously choose when and how 

the wave function collapses 

but that choice is always a 

throw of the dice 

yes the setup environment variables 

dictate that like god we must play dice with the universe 

as einstein would say 

heat washed on an empty beach 

one man caught on a barbed wire fence 

one man he resists 

is super synchronicity is real 

then their must be a renewable resource of meaning 

which means creation is generative 

and novel 

since old meaning dies from familiarity 

and the same old meaning become new 

from inheritance 

and adaptation 

she is so fine 

I know right where the money went 

this would make sense 

but it doesn’t create the cognitive dissonance that this does 

she issue fine 

there is no telling where the money went 

it describes a deceptive truth 

that only leads to greater integrations 

like all good songs 

that is my mission to chronicle deceptive truths 

that leads to greater integrations 

synchronicity 

they call it a hook 

I call it a trigger 

because the mechanics are intangible 

they move the human spirit 

and love songs must be treacherous 

traps 

for the deceptive to see themselves for what and who they really are 

and we are all deceptive 

but self awareness is our salvation 

I was the hidden style 

I walk into the fire 

words are very 

unnecessary 

words love violence 

break the silence 

painful to me 

come crashing in 

oh my little girl 

they can only do harm 

the futility of language 

one of those deceptive truths 

incipient integration 

vows are spoken 

to be broken 

feelings are intense 

wise less spoken 

all I ever wanted 

all I ever needed 

is here in my arms 

hey where did we go 

dancing when the rains came 

in the misty morning fog 

our hearts are thumping at you 

brown eyed girl 

what ever happened 

going down the old man 

with a transistor radio 

standing in the sunlight laughing 

hiding high 

making love in the green grass 

behind the stadium with you 

when the lights go down in the city 

and the sun shines on the bay 

do I want to be there in my city 

so you think you are lonely 

well my friend I am lonely too 

I want to get back to my city by the bay 

ew 

say morning hold up the cup 

there without you 

without your talons 

everything said in the same spirit 

what do you want me to do 

to make you sleep with me 

you are my obsession 

the muse 

requires total abandon 

fraught with obedience
