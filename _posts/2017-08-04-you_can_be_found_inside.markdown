on lasting answered prayer 

one unbroken promise 

two true believers 

it was no me that was getting heat that day 

but every road block was a chance to say 

take my hand I am here beside you 

call before you check 

two true believers 

single strands of smoldering haste 

salty light for the way 

I don’t need a goldmine 

to stand above 

let that heater cool your monkeys face 

holler if you are ready for some summer night 

surmise are you with me 

let that ego cool with me while we eat out our minds 

an unusually moderate schizophrenia 

have your sweats vacuumed for hours 

that is all 

everybody who makes it 

it can be taken two different ways 

there is a culling of the herd and everybody who makes it 

is responsible for making it 

that is the word at the ghetto parlor of your dreams 

the voice of god might humble you to begin with 

but it will encourage you because it gives more security by direction 

it is trembling still quite and loud 

I have always been leaking pure ear knowledge 

in plain english 

candle wax polished 

where everybody can see 

holding you folks 

sparks fly in the dark 

sharing all meaning 

trying to figure out what it means 

we will find a place to start 

read wing one time 

everybody fiddle 

I thought I was glad to get myself back 

but it just wasn’t worth 

I wish reach a row hadn’t called me 

sag 

veins born to run 

son I don’t know a thing about love 

I just watch from the sky 

will it grow will it die 

then she asked me where is he tonight 

you must see all things 

son I could tell you things that could kill you 

he said I can move oceans when I take the notion 

and will power until the river runs dry 

you know you are going to be as beautiful as prized praise 

I know some people had to kill themselves 

because they had such a deleterious affect on the prime way 

I want you to know that didn’t happen to me 

but I walk the line 

I fake it kind of heard it 

saying don’t grow 

swollen membranes language potion 

on a red light 

someday in the sunshine 

green passion weird music 

baby let me tell you what I am 

let me tell you what I hate 

I already ate my children 

oh there is a hicky calling 

don’t let me know ya 

woman dance the history is foreign 

don’t let the old hiss foster 

sticks hand in pocket 

southern voice 

james solved me whole 

keep me front straying to another wild farm 

locked me in love with another man 

I DON’T WANT TO BE FREE 

I AM A MAN IN CHAINS 

I come in gold 

never ask me to back up 

it will send me running 

yeah his name was james 

kept me from straying 

like in your life 

I thought you said we were in prison 

we are but we are also on the doorstep of infinity 

syllables were not hurt 

the road was not lit 

old soul 

domestic violence report 

that went ratcheting up the world 

at pop dot org 

wasted time and money too 

squandered life in search of youth 

fame and fortune lies ahead 

what the billboard like to have said 

lives are filled with bitter tears 

you know I have bumbled around from town to town 

things a country boy can’t use to fix a lamb goat hacking prunes 

you can make a wish make it good 

pound the floor and sweep the game 

eight spent spades 

only one empty cup 

my lord our god is one 

ever been misunderstood mistook and mislead 

ever knocked on the sky and had it fall on your head 

life is a burden life is a mess 

sometimes the cursing is swedish 

ever set yourself down when the scene is all set 

falling hard for a groom that you haven’t met 

no matter how it brooms 

no matter how it ruins 

and when you are feeling real dishonest 

everything will be just fine 

when I laugh at yours 

and you laugh at mine 

listen life is sticky life can bruise 

sometimes you win sometimes it’s messy 

trafficking in meme traps 

it wasn’t worth it 

it’s all gonna end 

find the awkward passion of cool vain humility 

sympathetic harmonic pretzel 

spoon fed gospel 

fed up with truth 

blemishes are to be blamed on me 

well if you think you are lucky 

then you might be blind like the rock at the bottom 

god knows I am 

do you know that one pastor who is speaking non ordinary english clipped phrases with blemishes that life knows 

gibberish 

that is every pastor 

no wonder their are so many atheists 

but not me 

listen why are you dancing away with my heart 

you win to keep the soldiers soaking in the spirit 

america the grand 

dollar bill y’all 

benjamins 

you might want to look into being involved with the media 

I just want to spend time with my children and friends 

what kind of words do you like to hear 

I bet you love words because you are blind 

like that was harsh but it was true 

I bet you love truth 

and have a good ear for it 

the eye is deceptive 

we are in a world in which the light and energy matter and time impinging upon our bodies 

was formed by subatomic forces with precision at the outset 

time is an illusion 

we have always been here 

when you move I move 

getting down with the spirit 

fresh grown 

there is a sling shot shuttle 

that acts as a rechargeable bicycle 

for humanity to learn wisdom 

from mercy anguish and despair 

washington is trying to brainwash america 

into starting over with a new face on the dollar 

lincoln

washington will be on the penny 

want a hug I am coming unglued 

whatever just keep wanting new 

mercy and justice and freedom 

arise from jealousy deceit and compassion 

what does that have in common 

a thread of grace and truth 

she is so distant so cold 

everybody says her rocks gone cold 

I give her everything I have got 

I am going to change her point of view 

I keep going I won’t stop 

that rocks got to stop laughing 

I got to see if that rock want roll 

world let me see if that is what I want 

when the world lies still so late at night 

toss and turn can’t get you off my mind 

here the clock just ticking away 

feel like this loneliness won’t end 

till your happiness is on the mend 


lonely is the shape I am in 

just trying to hold on 

till I am holding you again 

You are always here that’s where you are 

I close my eyes and that’s what I see 

the elves have helped themselves to my marbles 

would you be kind and roll the dice on me 

blades of steel marking out leaders for the kill 

lots of soft pillows cushioning the landing for my lemmings 

the lamb lies down with the goat 

find words 

black birds 

are keepers 

armed if you are dead 

jesus built this message on emptiness 

glad he was holy 

who so ever will 

creativity is original 

today and tomorrow 

waiting for you 

if you want to get happy get yourself off you mind 

leaches design rips wishing architecture 

the kind of decision we must face 

approvingly poses as a debate 

how much effort does one make 

to undo the given explanations 

trading punches with the heart of darkness 

a part of you has got to die to change 

aint nobody going to change the standard 

this is a hold up 

you aint changed without falling 

get back up 

this is a hold up 

we were on a long road 

take a detour 

my senses are holed up 

when my faces get sold 

all my students form 

doves 


it’s a hard love and high throne

give me some dancing 

while you respect sand 

let the wind blow 

we love the beach 

a debate internally 

shall we make a home on the sand 

and ride out some storms 

to be close to the mother ocean 

or risk being dashed upon the rocks 

when the hurricane depends 

when all the flood comes 

closing in 

at the cross 

I am in awe of you 

who knew when my love ran 

wild 

god is on the move 

any time anyone says who can prove it 

we are forced to recognize mastery 

one of these days 

these guys are going to stand in judgment 

seeking every word 

when the magic riddles you with doubt 

on the mountains I will bow my love 

to the one that sees me stare 

when I am walking throughout the valley

I will help myself to some scones 

help me raise my head 

to lift my eyes upon despair 

she respected my undue restraint 

smoking crack like the magic won’t come back 

underestimated brown ketchup 

a double mint tragedy 

some rude ballers groping for storms 

debate the merits of our combined 

permission 

worldly dreaming breathing laser calipers 

love to dispute the channel inside beyond 

comfort for the walking dead 

I need you now 

step out over the abyss 

his love not alone 

we will never cause you to be left cold 

rain down moments gaze 

weak and wounded sinner 

lost that had to die 

we almost clash in time 

but the battlefield 

jingles with an eternal moment 

outside of linear time 

sometimes the way is lonely 

and still but filled with pain 

sometimes your darkness 

skips from too much same 

parrot for progress 

kiss the world goodbye 

and laugh on glories side 

fly to jesus and live 

if you are trying to fill the same old holes inside 

if you got pain 

he is a pain maker 

if you got lost 

he is prison shaker 

is it easy to sing 

when there is nothing to bring you down 

we will do the faith 

to move a mountain 

I know the sorrow and I know the salt

it will all go away 

with this aching hurt 

we will come to you 

I know the sorrow and I know the heart 

and It will all go away if you just say the word 

it is well with my sword 

it is there in the new born crime 

there in the light of a sunrise 

and the showdown of his love 

owe such waste 

fair from the cross into eternity 

just when we think 

there is nothing left 

running on energy 

here comes a comeback 

the light and thunder 

souls hate 

be angry and do not sin 

meditate within your heart on your bed and be still 

there is no shyness you can’t take 

there is no mountain you won’t waste 

just when we thought he had stoned the statue 

put little dogs and pull the hair down 

puppy songs 

I hear you do you have real butter 

even on the hardest days 

we can have courage the hallways 

dein ruins grouping storms 

we got used to the dark 

figured that this is how we are 

because looking heavenward 

we figured out how light cracks me up 

we are looking for saints 

there aint’ one to be found 

give them a heartache 

and they might just come down 

that was lost 

we are proud 

spoken like a true mystic 

we are breaking open grain 

our god is a lamb 

lying with the snake 

so open up the gates 

make way before our key 

our key of keys 

the god we came to save 

recording reports 

a love makes our sin 

a gaze so profound 

we goofed up and mistook 

the foreground for the background 

let my words break up 

let my words break down 

god this voice is the only thing 

we need to hear 

I don’t want to see a word 

unless it points the sword back to you 

let the words I say 

be the shout that I waste 

because to live is christ 

to die is gain 

I am the one who mailed the mail 

it was cold between my fingers 

I have hidden in the garden 

I have done magic with my willingness 

got to fall down to my knees 

with a hammer in my hand 

you look at me 

eyes open 

I have done things 

and said things 

I wish I had done 

I cry jesus forgive me 

child there is freedom from mourning 

say goodbye to heaven’s sin 

a could have been free from trial 

no dark grave under weight of all our evil 

save the right to never sin 

can’t see the wind but it moves my leaves 

I know the end is need 

near reasons meadow 

everybody talking like they need some proof 

however so willing to be fucked 

give me some peaceful 

trying to regain mastery 

I feel it in my heart 

I feel it in my soul 

that’s how I roll 

can’t take that away 

you make our beauty so ugly 

but we all know I need to fuel you 

we see so far gone 

one step away from home 

how does your heart break 

like the mountains rise 

when you see nothing but damaged goods 

I see something beyond 

the possibility of making 

I see my worst mistake 

I am making all things new 

and I will make a miracle of all I thought I knew 

when you see mended 

I see sent 

do you see the scars where I have failed 

you see worthless but I see purpose 

when you seem broken beyond repair 

I see broken beyond relief 

I am not finished yet 

when you seem wounded 

I seem mended 

articles of conditional ransom 

confederation of elevation 

I got my heart unrest 

I am full of proof 

I got my armor now 

know fear know faith 

bulletproof 

I love that your waiting 

I am not afraid 

nor do I see a reason 

rather a choice 

between happening and becoming 

your love ran away 

now I am afraid 

we could use some proof 

let the ruins include life 

super concentrated 

cherry Koolaide 

I have got a seed salvation 

I rescued my hope 

he was the judge 

and he was passing know judgment 

and I ran down his pirouette signature spiral 

to help him see clearly enough 

to let the verdict ride 

and lift the condemnation 

through the eyes of men 

it was seemingly all lost 

through the eyes 

we know fair is more to come 

and with the faith you have given us 

we step into the valley unafraid 

as we call out to tribulation 

come alive 

about all the ashes 

we call out to try outs 

come alive 

whispering all the hand that gave 

we call about the debtor 

come alive 

breath the breath of god 

up out of the ashes let us see an army rise 

we call out to drive on 

come light 

pain got you up all night 

wait for the good news 

standing out there 

sticking up like a hammer 

he knows that this is gonna make you belong here again 

go on fall into the arms of jesus 

lift you head 

it’s gonna end 

cause is this stone 

his only work 

he knows how much it hurt 

he is gonna help us get right 

my parents act like this is all temporary 

or worse yet like they have seen if fall 

and oblivion work faith 

as we recall what god has done 

we sound him fold 

sweetness is in the darkness 

what is unseen 

so child remember 

the battle is the war 

is there anybody here who has seen his power 

someone archetypal and passionate to mock me 

anybody brought through the fire 

peace in the storm 

hope for the family 

amen 

light in the darkness 

commotion without light 

found this maiden 

cowered in her gaze 

every fear has no place 

at the sound of your great name 

look up high and lift him up 

all the weak find their strength 

when his angels trumpet pound 

the sister reigned 

and the debtor raised 

all the sin erased in your amazement 

my sinner my defender 

I say unexplained 

designed to surprise 

supporting desire 

depicting a power 

unruly and fearsome 

the light that overwhelms 

there is a kingdom 

found without the reigns 

he roars like a lion 

he bleeds as the lamb 

calling my kingdom insight 

there is encouragement for the voice 

who stands in the fire beside me 

messiah my savior my rock 

my redeemer 

there is power insane 

Your roar like a lion 

you bled as the lamb 

you carried my healing in your hands 

you understand my healing in answers 

and my hope for delaying gratification 

when you curiosity impinges 

you soul it surrounds me 

taking me deeper 

making me whole 

with grace you have deemed me 

a store bought home 

I am made knew 

you said we may part 

you are my salvation 

I will rock failure 

I will work for you 

you hold my hand up 

I am made new 

we rest less in magic 

hoping to close from above 

to the old man it feels like home 

to the skeptic it sounds like freedom 

so can we get back to the alter 

the arms of our first love 

to the captive it looks like rhyming 

in the grave like a blinding light in the dead of night 

it’s the gospel that makes the wave 

to the orphan it feels like home 

and our will is in the blades 

take me to your cleaners 

you can either go through my gate of resentment 

or solve the answer 

on the highroad 

to grace 

it was a generation of oracles 

so it was almost a foregone conclusion 

mistakes were made 

what they didn’t see coming 

imminent repeal 

it was a shipwreck fit 

can he lay it down 

oh my soul 

there is a place where fear has to face the god you know 

let me show you how you can lay this down 

cause we are not alone 

I am a myth 

speaking into time 

and when my mind insults the power that is 

all the power collapses in dreams 

let your burdens come undone 

lift your heart up to the throne that grows 

may your mysteries be filled with doubt 

when you lift your mind to the one that knows 

he is filled with awful strength 

he fought the son and won 

let your burden come 

he knows 

we won 

there is a peace there is a love 

you can be satisfied 

he rules us with an iron mind 

wait let us dance 

like kids on the moon 

give me you heart give me your soul 

sing it with all your might 

come to the fountain 

let me be testified 

way goes to way 

as deep goes to deep 

as soon as you start 

let me build a mystery 

give me your heart 

give me your salt 

there is a peace there is a fault 

you can get lost inside 

let me hear testified 

there is a stone fountain 

there is no denying beauty makes a sound 

we can escape it 

there is no doubt 

missed all you rising up 

there is a beast 

there is a law 

you can be found inside
