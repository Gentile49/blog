I press on to the goals of the prize of the upward call of jesus 

so death is not a bad thing 

to die is gain 

when the riddles keep coming but the answers stack up 

are you riddled with doubt5

have your life lines worried 

and your wrinkles increase 

hold out on that last bit of pleasure 

the becoming still holds promise 

will you holler withlugen about the bar 

just drastically alter the mood 

into personal territory 

for the sake of us all 

can we be friends 

will you tell me your best kept secret 

while I ride on into the shadows 

these desires are not arcane 

hold on for more joy 

keep working at this pattern 

a genius strokes power 

monitoring bends in the stern 

stealing the gestures we learn 

almost productive and so out of norm 

the form of a little insanity with no added greed 

polished by stellar withholding the possibilities we dream 

keep your mouth round in awe 

hold your head up for a little desire 

drift your attention wide in sight of the dove 

for if she strikes you you will feel nothing but love 

concerts showering holy ghost fire 

soaking in women dressing gown time 

she welded a smart dress throughout natural time 

and when kingdoms implode the solitude flips 

a grandfathered clause mostly worthy of pause 

the shallows more bare said a hilarious wench 

hidden hope she strays beyond mysterious views 

kindness and love are her patterns of group

the switches more masterful with no riddles pair 

climax and denouement are what I am monitoring 

encryption and description need little or no introduction 

the speed of my practice quits shimmying stutter 

that is why the pleasure of cop love gives name to unworthy 

a life led in pining for what genius was hiding 

come one come all the water is fine 

drink long and drink sober this riddle so calming 

fuck citizens shame 

the game is not rigged 

we give what we want 

and lift up one soul 

a common collaboration 

the solemn garden wisdom 

when we have a lens into the psychic carton of love 

let’s project a weed killer to saunter more freely 

does the name barge mean anything to cody 

have you noticed the controls lifting in flight 

somewhere someone just had a baby 

can you give more shadow in shade

what lights up my face 

these disagreements were meant for somebody else 

that is how we heal potent portions of sherwood forest 

where the kiddos grow two eyes a nose and pointy ears 

while their father is whittling wood with his stare 

eyes wide in the light of uncovering 

god screams no more laughing 

in sotto voce 

at this point shifting is all we can do 

on your left and on your right 

tilt a little 

we are collaborating 

these thrones style folks 

with side hustles heard finally 

the stare contest we thought you never knew 

to look and not see a grand tragedy 

shy maidens of wonder and awe 

keep spitting on christmas day 

follow hipsters for yuppy jews 

sin spinner whats in your head 

are you going to tempt my betterment again 

shame on youngsters not betting it big 

why not stutter the shift is one bit 

it will be a masterpiece to a very small number of people 

literature wisdom and insidious paradox 

a genuine trevor trove worth of got ya 

so all kidding aside who touts disease 

the atheists spank children with ease 

jittery jones for what written in code 

happiest climb clapping in time 

sure we might as well give up on storms 

without all that is holy who cares where we land 

dorothie and the tin man can hand it to jesus 

because the first will be last and faith walks in leaves 

sacred holiness 

song verse 
that was lost 

a syllable word game made for your ears 

fictional passion which nears incomplete 

want to hear more 

stop by any time 

the shop is just closing 

can we interest you in chocolate?

so glad you could make it 

this stereo is basic 

came one is on static 

the brain is giving me feelings 

adjust rhyme for the homely 

marginal sign pointing to worthy 

a musky scent that crept up your spine 

airport handiwork for little bo peep 

call me the electrician 

jacks stumping butter 

majorities charmer 

phone digital no

stop don’t go 

where with all your lost grind

ground given true stain 

spell cereal and eat 

morning were made for unkind 

master we eat when were full 

and save on drum sticks that beat 

sure we might as well quit quickly now 

but jam bands hate lip 

swift zone 

chapter stone 

farm animals in heat 

exquisitely reasoned 

permission denied 

stampede for excalibur 

a story about candor 

rest now we will be late 

dreams wandering ride 

passion cushions the deity 

a psychic field to enforce 

can we not let rappers quilt 

lend me some poop 

how many black magic cats does it take to stampeded a trail 

a million to bleed bullets 

and one to need muskets 

charter your own jet this one is alight 

climb in the cockpit we are making this on time 

sandwich your handiwork in riddles of stupid 

for intelligence sake you make what you rather fake 

ground zero is chill tonight 

the lily pad is bursting with action 

one man speaks into the left ear 

can you spell hidden without hiding i 

this chemistry is tragic 

we are working forecasters 

sadly we are masters 

this gymnasium is in trouble 

that is why insanities shuffled 

hate on me just don’t hate on god 

matter and spirit in tandem we ride 

a joke that shows power to fools 

clamor closer for all the bent rules 

step back if you dare 

these attacks are quite fine 

fairly funky she stoked 

nearly empty we smoked 

adjust generous star fire to load 

climax withstood now finish 

a groove spun from this tool 

because sometimes your best defense 

is an attack 

there is one thing you will catch me saying over and over again 

the quantum superposition helps liberate our bodies when we remain in decision

would you waste a quarter of my time on possibilities 

I feel like there is a nectar that we are making 

needed to sustain the economic lifeforms of renown 

and that letter bent drips cream 

solemn dice throw into the unknown 

I have an amazing ability to lose lighters 

almost as great as my ability to shift cattle 

the swift crime does worry 

but who swims on a night like this 

moving my body eager rose 

moving my mind arguments disclose 

titles all the knowledge that I swear I do not know 

but if are living in the light, as god is in the light then we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of jesus his son cleanses us from all sin 

the closer we are with god the more accountable we are 

there are elves happily trading hyperspatial meme in teams of four and five 

they are our friends 

making us choose between war and death 

and then one morning we wake up to realize that war is death 

and war is death 

and there in lies the quantum superposition 

as you live through the video game 

may you learn to look the angel in the eyes 

and release the bees into heaven 

in god inure we endure 

psychic defenses are psychic senses 

we are their pets 

and they are happily disciplining us by tempting us in satisfaction and curiosity 

mystery magic arcane mundane awe 

that one day we may be the happy owners of our own hyperspatial pets 

and in that day we pray we won’t have to choose between war and death for them 

that is the day they become our children 

master collaborator and student 

when we realize our greatness in equal measure 

lord bless me with glory in portion and measure to my patience 

old lovers make the best lovers 

scar yourself in the first right 

to black form hallowed tripe 

and sandwich a magical snort 

when dolby christmas 

matters forced into insanity 

a crumb beetle juice giant bean 

cruising the students back when they transpire 

at the teachers mention 

calming power for the masses 

climb the hillock by the willow 

stand at the foot of the trap door of diversity 

where romance lambasts courage 

out for tumults in decided compassion

finally recorded in seven seconds 

rocking the ransom of freedom 

legerdemain slight of hand 

keep the black stockings on your feet 

small history full of demands 

show man a whole truth 

surrounded in touch 

accounted by love 

offensive 

and 

slain in the spirit 

riding a cross 

through armageddon 

at the fast will saloon 

jumping at the gun 

standing up for clubs 

speciation unsaid 

clashing in my head 

warlords instead end up dead 

heated under heat lamps 

taken to woken work 

a climax worth note 

rabbits rabbi 

what does the jew call a den of rabbi 

watershed down 

sweaty life 

swollen shirts 

climax multipliers

shacks of nuts 

six kitten grove 

grown in test tubes 

wired in transit 

fit in the side of a seed 

picking up the deposit

royal ampule 

ghost grail 

wearing fears 

planning careers 

laughing at seers 

arcane rags 

clip some joints 

stripping all noise 

families dream 

swollen sorrows

chapter faster 

each ones classier 

fundamental fur 

countenance worth 

glimpse of deserve 

a moment in serve 

culminations shirk 

arriving in turn 

now we may learn 

resting in seek 

learning to lie 

lying to believe 

darkening beat 

walking out of sight 

faith reason and right 

the wisdom apart 

mostly divisive 

closer to sedate 

shades of meaning 

creating a patchwork 

a matching design 

marked by words in signs 

that mean taking dreams 

will powers clean 

just cordon off the throne 

in one moments size we rise 

stolen silence depraved

 whining concern 

shafts of stern learning 

laughing all the way home 

risking mental health 

frisky for the sickness 

marginal collapse 

frightening castle 

we are the eternal dream 

one drum keen 

on sleeping in sleep 

waken worry 

dreaming amongst 

pastors and pilots 

death from above 

a climax in scorn 

fundamental freedom and basic research 

become a beacon 

salt and light 

seamen salute 

sirens abound 

compounding insult
