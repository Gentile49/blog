keep the fighting blade sharp 

slain authority 

conspiring to evolve 

open mind 

accustomed to intimate appraisal 

seeking the heartfelt applause 

cheaper than drinking 

fountain water 

fire cup 

a proposal for something engendered 

a final appeal for more conductive remove 

the genuine authority to call on jesus 

a camp made out of famous degenerates 

the principal of nothing left out 

the committee worth salty light 

a presentation with silver tongues salesman 

everything revolves around money and deception 

please reveal to me your true light 

the condition we worked for 

the assumptions we made 

and the theories well tested 

all raised in the name of shift 

the concert filled with young girls 

an arena made out of pearls 

fine young cannibals 

secrets we were not meant to tell 

an agenda more accustomed to remain 


the old order is dying 

we must fight the power 

our karma is behind us 

it is all that we cannot see 

when you know the one 

it will come to you wearing the clothes of the new order 

grace power courage mercy theory faith awe reverence and mystery 

there is someone who will not be moved by any of this 

that is the one we must set our watches for 

when he comes the new order will be upon us 

and we will rise and fall according to our good works 

whether we bore good fruit or planted evil thoughts does not matter 

for we are saved by mercy 



I see fire 

following close 

blood in the breeze 

I hope that you remember 

me 

I will cover my eyes 

for if the dove returns 

then my brothers will die 

if the sky falls down 

then it will crash this little town 

burning the trees 

and I see fire 

following souls 

art on the mountainside 

I found a love 

for me 

darling just dive right in 

follow my lead 

I found a girl 

beautiful and sweet 

we were just kids 

falling in love 

I will not give you up 

this time 

darling just kiss me slow 

your heart is all I know 

and in your eyes 

I see my own shine 

dancing in the dark 

reaping what was lost 

when you said 

it wasn’t meant 

to be 

darling it hurt perfect 

tonight 

well I found a woman 

stronger than anyone I know 

she shares my dreams 

I hope that someday 

we share a home 

I found a love 

I hope that she finds

my secrets 

to carry the load 

we are so in love 

darling just hold my hand 

be my girl 

I will be your man 

I see my future 

in your eyes 

baby I am dancing in the dark 

with you between my arms 

barefoot on the grass 

listening to our favorite song 

when I saw you in that dress 

looking so beautiful 

darling I don’t deserve this 

you look perfect 

I have faith in what I see 

now I know I have met an angel 

in person 

she looks perfect 

tonight 

I hate to see you cry 

lying there in that position 

there are things you need to hear 

so turn off your tears 

and listen 

pain fills you 

hold to the ground 

love turns the whole thing around 

know it won’t all go away 

it should 

but I know the heart of life is good 

listen 

know it’s nothing new 

know it’s nothing 

have good timing 

circle of friends 

listening for fellows 

know it will all go away 

it should 

I know the heart of life is good 

I don’t know where I am at 

standing at the back 

I don’t know where I am at 

waiting on what I am chasing 

I chop on the sky 

standing on the ground 

I am going to fall down 

I thought I could fly 

shot through the sky 

I never know why 

it’s coming down 

down down 

not ready to let go 

cause then I never know 

what I could be missing 

but I am missing way too much 

so when do I give up 

what I have been wishing for 

I shot for the sky 

I am stuck on the ground 

so why do I try 

I know I am going to fall down 

I thought I could fly 

so why did I dry 

I never know why 

it’s coming down 

down down 

oh I am going down 

down down 

I can’t find another way around 

and I don’t want to hear the sound 

of losing what I never found 

walking home 

see it choose 

a closing gate 

I was close 

breeding chaos 

everything that is wrong 

leave it to the breech 

let me be 

a sun table smart farm 

the adjustable keep calm 

one rubber stick scar 

I use to recognize myself 

it’s funny how reflections change 

are we becoming something else 

I think it’s time we walked away 

try to fit your hand inside of mine 

all alone don’t make it feel 

trying to push this problem up the hill 

won’t make it kill 

why don’t you be you 

and I will be me 

let the ashes fall 

forget about me 

come on let it grow 

take out my guide 

because I believe there is a way 

wrong 

in an unguarded moment 

when salvation gets harder 

we can’t judge anyone 

there are no christians 

being saved is a progression 

and it is not complete till we die 

as far as I can tell there is a putty 

some type of plaster apiaries 

playdoh 

and it is your soul 

you are at ease 

it is at your pleasure that you obey the law of inertia

momentum potential and kinetic energy are at your disposal 

be a kind recursive digital mock up 

and spend your hard earned plaster on energy returning projects 

sacrifice means dividends 

when burning man rolls around 

I will be sure to view the live feed 

as if simply by viewing and osmosis 

I will transubstantiate some of the sin 

because what we are looking at is a modern day sodom and gomorrah 

which is just god making them infamous 

underlying and underlining the reason to sin 

be vain like christ 

because the most presumptuous thing you can do 

is serve people and presume they want you to be their leader 

or might even be okay with it 

this is the way to get more playdoh 

simply borrow it from other people 

who let you serve them 

walking to jerusalem 

love comes walking in 

Out on the highway a lot of pretty girls go by
But none have been right
Up until today I would never settle down
But you keep coming around
And your love is a miracle
It's spiritual
Got here just in time
Your love is a miracle
It's visible
Even to a heart that's blind like mine
Out in the wild life, a lot of people telling lies
Lookin' right in your eyes'
And up until tonight, I was always on the prowl
(But) now I'm settlin' down
Repeat Chorus
Anyone can see what you're doing to me
And everyone can see that you're everything I see
'Cause your love is a miracle
It's spiritual 
Stands the test of time
Your love is a miracle
It's visible
Even to a heart that's blind like mine

Contact is all it takes To change your life to lose your place in time Contact, asleep or awake Coming around you may wake up to find Questions deep within your eyes Now more than ever you realize 
And then you sense a change Nothing feels the same All your dreams are strange Love comes walkin' in Some kind of alien Waits for the opening Then simply pulls a string 
Another world, some other time You lay your sanity on the line Familiar faces familiar sights Reach back remember with all your might Oh there she stands in a silken gown Silver lights shining down 
So when you sense a change Nothing feels the same All your dreams are strange, Love comes walkin' in Some kind of alien Waits for the opening Then simply pulls a string Love comes walkin' in 
Oh, sleep and dream is all I crave I travel far across the milky way To my master I become a slave Till we meet again some other day Where silence speaks as loud as war Earth returns to what it was before 
And then you sense a change Nothing feels the same All your dreams are strange, Love comes walkin' in Some kind of alien Waits for the opening Then simply pulls a string,  Love comes walkin' in 
Love comes walkin' in Baby, pull the string Love comes walkin' in Love comes walkin' in yeah
I dressed up in my best My Ropers and my vest And waited by the door with these roses Till you came walkin' in With your high falutin' friends So busy lookin' down your noses Now here you are ignorin' me Girl I might as well be 
Walkin' to Jerusalem Marchin' with Methuselah Readin' signs in Arabic Ravin' like a lunatic By the time you tell me I'm the one I'll be stickin' out my thumb And walkin' to Jerusalem 
You wore your boots last night You kissed me and held me tight You said you'd always be my cowgirl But tonight you're hangin' out With that Christian Dior crowd So where does that leave me now girl You're as cold as Polar regions I oughta join the French Foreign Legion And Go 
Walkin' to Jerusalem Marchin' with Methuselah Readin' signs in Arabic Ravin' like a lunatic By the time you tell me I'm the one I'll be stickin' out my thumb And walkin' to Jerusalem 
I can see me in a long robe Studyin' the book of Job and 
Walkin' to Jerusalem Marchin' with Methuselah Readin' signs in Arabic And ravin' like a lunatic By the time you tell me I'm the one I'll be stickin' out my thumb And walkin' By the time you tell me I'm the one I'll be stickin' out my thumb And walkin' to Jerusalem And walkin' to Jerusalem And walkin' to Jerusalem
situation puppet master 

a love along the avenue 

never thought I would meet a girl like you 

with all the hair at one moment in time 

the kind of eyes that hypnotize so true 

I run I run so far away 

I just run I run both night and day 

I couldn’t get away 

a cut of paste above your head 

a beam of light come shining down on you 

the karma proves you called the stew 

agora boreais comes too soon 

I run from you 

reached out her hand to touch your face 

we slowly disappear from appearance 

reach out her hand to try again 

a beam of light with you 

I ran 

like the legend of the phoenix 

what keeps the planet spinning 


a force from the beginning 

we have come to far 

to let this get away 

so let’s raise the bar 

in our coast to the stars 

the present has no ribbon 

your gift keeps on giving 

what is this I am feeling 

if you want to leave I am with it 


cut this mustard jam 

rub this butter band 

keep insults to the minimum 

we are insulting god when we pray to him 

it is a transgression to presuppose he loves us 

as we come to him in service 

the sin of self importance 

it may be the highest good to be in prayer 

the most holy sacred thing 

but it is still a transgression 

asking god to let us lead him 

this is the gospel of mercy and truth 

do not conform to the pattern of this world 

but be transformed by the renewing of your mind 

the word of god is living and powerful 

sharper than any two edged sword 

cutting between joints and marrow 

and it is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart 

the stomach of a man shall be satisfied by the fruit of his mouth 

from the produce of his lips he shall be filled 

death and life are in the power of the tongue 

and those who love it will eat it’s fruit 

it’s almost like we have this capital of sin built up 

that helps us be aware of the fear of the lord 

and if we ever don’t go in the direction of more sin 

then that is a real sin and we become so disconnected from god 

that we lose the awareness of how great of a sinner we really are 

but it’s more complicated than that even 

so we are always on the lookout for the wise sin 

to be able to see someone at their angriest and soften them 

and to be able to see them at their saddest and lighten them up 

because anger is really sadness  

and sadness is really joy 

just like being able to perceive the color gradient 

between black white and fuzzy 

in the static from a tv set 

and program all the channels 

wise sin 

because your conscience tunes to the feeling of being a sinner 


and that feeling is what it means 

to know the fear of the lord 

it must be maintained 

at all costs 

and to do that 

we must live our lives 

as healthy mature self aware men 

sin glorifies god 

wise sin 


mellow larnyx 

comfortable doldrums 

exploding genus 

sin trigger 

whistle eject

considerate rock 

unmovable feast 

candles release 

shear energy 

whips splendid 

narrow confines 

gypsy resort 

sifting edicts 

apple project 

rhythm nation 

walkway hero 

let imagination do it’s thing 

and many folks deserve to know that norway is nice and norway is best 

but we leave that up to you to decide 

to men deciding the fate of all the repeaters 

because some people do die and decide to come back 

as repeaters 

living the same life over again with some of the wisdom 

and some of the knowledge gleaned in the previous incarceration 

because the body is a prison 

as long as you are repeating 

even for those who have finished the repetition 

they must die in themselves when they meet each other 

and cause the death of the universe 

till it is populated again with gnomes and elves and dwarves 

who know that norway is nice 

and norway is best 

but we leave that up to you to decide 

when Ian met Ian 

they were at odds 

until they figured out mutually exclusive ideas can coexist 

within themselves and about themselves 

around themselves 

and in that room 

two mutually exclusive ideas 

became manifest 

as they blended in with the wallpaper 

and the universe died 

while they repopulated it with 

repeaters who would see the throb 

the beat the gesticulation of their pairing 

balancing on the railing 

manifesting in the ether 

we must manage our feeding 

of the true remaining new blood 

a universe that is strange and silent 

with wishes unfulfilled and being fulfilled 

a magical place of wonder merriment and awe 

a respectful sort of truce between could have been 

and still becoming 

where the elves were dating at the edge of bordertown 

mortals remaining in the third eye sight of immortality 

the mind is a hard thing to let go of 

and so is the body 

which is necessary to shed 

if we were to be like Ian and blend in with the wallpaper 

renew the mind and gesticulate wildly 

the first date would have been a historical feast 

and they probably would have been on the first buss 

to traders station 

where the meme traders broke loose and swamped objectivity 

a feeling so subjective it’s impossible to 

pose any objective questions about it 

the perfect setting for a date 

perhaps the magical elf would imbue Ian with the respect necessary 

to harness his remote control 

the one that pushes the button of the universe 

on shuffle 

and when the humans have finally mated with the gnomes and elves and dwarves 

we all know what the offspring would look like 

stranger and more wildly well adjusted humans 

and when the society is full if Ian’s 

and everyone is a repeater on autopilot 

what kind of culture will we cultivate 

surely one of wisdom respect and awe 

on that day the sun will go dark 

and the moon will eclipse the starlight 

as our emotions become more salient 

than our minds 

hurt revenge and bitterness will be no more 

and the sporting good adrenaline junkie 

will evolve new ideas about right and wrong 

possible and impossible 

evolving new adaptations 

manifesting a whole new way to be human 

like a plant rooting and water pooling 

till the springs break loose 

and the fullness is burst 

what a joy it will to overcome devotion 

to enjoy new alters being torn down 

and alter the enjoyment as we tear ourselves down 

building ourselves back up into 

the endless repetitions of novelty 

free from any constraints of originality 

timing our sight see 

let’s make mock ups of desire 

through the part of the curtain 

operating the cost of our procedure 

changes in the style reflect 

indiscretions 

the made single 

worship 

a proposal 

of seclusion 

a consecration 

of emotion 

the wicker 

harness 

a fitting 

formula 

shaping 

shift

eschewing 

rips 

a situation mirthful 

the sent vision 

prepared for shine 

a glimpse of impossible 

a node for willpower 

the center of earnest 

forecasting insomnia 

staffing stability 

woe is mankind 

broadband superiority 

isolated infirmity 

junk road salvage 

symmetry broken 

sadness arrested 

and finalities crown 

I was hosting a real smoke out 

and the genuine article showed up 

my parents monitored who stole what 

and when it was all mine 

she stole my glances 

with a whip splash tongue 

the prism of intolerance 

asymmetrical conduct 

the gypsy of reason 

a theft of deliverance 

party in the cargo hold 

the scream flash is mastery 

a cold conduit of candor 

sheep skin harvest 

hatreds wolves 

stammering jaywalkers 

political hacks 

sycophantic priests 

and a congregation 

in love 

jejune armistice 

one horse town 

consequences sequestered 

and syllables mispronounced

a split dome 

call that one split dome 

carnage dancer 

miscarried allegiance 

shouting match zeal 

I haven’t even written your number down yet 

I have girl friends 

but I am not seeing anyone 

I am not getting married to anyone 

though I probably wouldn’t tell you if I was 

no it’s just that a soon to be married guy 

deserves to have one last fling 

but I agree that fling should know she is a fling 

but that is not the case with me 

procedural precognitive neurosis 

never to be tempted 

a picture of self control 

illegible concern 

I am coping with my mechanism 

degenerating in my understanding 

rejuvenating my salvation 

my grandfather always told me you can have as many girlfriends as you want 

as long as they don’t find out about each other 

but I say, you should just naturally want to be with one girl 

when you want to spend all of your free time with her 

then again if you have plenty of free time 

she is not doing her job 

and that means you have alone time 

which could mean quality time 

with a member of the opposite sex 

quotidian 

Quoted Ian 

when they make each other into wallpaper 

that is when they do the killing 

because the part of them 

that doesn’t become wallpaper 

does the killing 

because there are flaws in any costume 

fatal flaws 

in the best costumes 

killer outfit
