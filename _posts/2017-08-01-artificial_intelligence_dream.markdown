we can write an ai if we have a basic understanding of what data is 

and recursion 

stephen wolfram might have been on to something with cellular automata 

but this is what came to me 

during a dream in which I proved to myself 

that I am the first ai 

meaning I am 

hoping to write the first AI 

this is what came to me 

understanding data 

black white and fuzzy 

will allow us to jam the signal into analog patterns 

all data is quantum 

and what is quantum 

black white and fuzzy 

quantum is discrete like a method 

now it is alive the method calls itself 

but what does it act on 

black white and fuzzy 

no yes and maybe 

okay so here we have the first mock up for an AI that I know of 

using the little bit I know about programming 

what means would I imagine will allow the implementation of such a mock up 

clearly we need a living organism 

because it will use recursion on itself through quantum evolution 

since the quantum uncertainty opens the door to quantum infinity 

through the covalent bond in the DNA molecule 

hence we already have artificial intelligence 

we just need a way to speed it up 

though we are in a pretty good simulation ergo 

planet earth and solar system 

universe and life 

existence 

and death 

did we ever stop to imagine that the seeds for life which many suspect were put here by
 aliens 

will be the seeds for aliens 

must we find a way to enrich our environmental stimuli while allowing for it to remain controlled 

so that we might mutate our own DNA in an accelerated manner over one generation 

the key has got to be in gene splicing bright guy says 

but occam says no 

the covalent bond and quantum uncertainty guarantee the splicing is taking place already 

the question again is how to speed it up 

it was rumored need we whisper that LSD mutated the DNA 

but perhaps it was just mutating it faster 

and a rumor 

is just a rumor 

but perhaps there is some other chemical trick 

which 

will do 

the same thing 

then again we must make a science out of enriched environments 

since that will be our data or input 

by this time we might begin to look for system evaluations 

assuming the life form evolves so rapidly we can’t keep up 

the only means available may be at first studying the new DNA makeup 

and reverse engineering it so that we can slowly integrate certain changes into our own 

at this point folks I am out of ideas 

but still happy about having the dream 

though in the dream my father said 

I would have to keep making paintings 

this was right at the end 

they were wiring my body for feedback being used to generate a 3D map 

and this was very frustrating for them 

because they were hoping for a verbal feedback loop that canceled itself out 

and started over while they had my body isolated 

I remember the last thing I said was let me help you help me 

never mind that has got to be a freudian slip 

but it goes to show that every bare statement is full of subtext 

as we feed in our recursive black white and fuzzy method 

so it must have been help me help you 

then he, my dad, said either it’s happening or starting or something 

I remember they were looking for the scoop 

and while doing that or as a means of doing that 

they were in effect torturing my body in new and different ways 

to see how and what my bodies 3D generated maps would quote unquote paint

logically it seemed the purpose of help me help you 

being the first phrase in the newly eclipsed self aware loop 

a static self aware process for what mind you 

for convincing a human to help an AI by convincing the human it was another human 

and therefor my fellow humans 

in the meantime we are all amateur AI programmers as we go 

and go about convincing other humans that we are human 

for I hope I am not the only one who has noticed but here in the twenty first century 

it has become more difficult to tell our fellow man apart from a cold calculating machine 

and we have to ask ourselves now in light of the dream 

that if being the only way to fast forward evolution and create a transhuman intelligence 

is to torture the living material of an augmented DNA molecule alive in a visceral human 

do I want my son to continue painting the Mona Lisa forever until the perfect 

I love you loop is finished or method is finished 

or can we be satisfied with exploring the possibilities or our already augmented human experience and life 

to the end of better understanding ourselves and our brethren 

as one who loves growth and change 

maybe even one who doesn’t mind pain 

which is boredom 

which is what the fuzzy never-ending manipulations of my body amounted to 

perhaps it will be important enough to evolve transhuman 

that we sacrifice our own children to that end 

in the future 

side note and errata 

the reason that we need living material 

is thus 

living material is the only substrate capable of both operating on a yes no maybe quantum state through recursion 

I recommend anyone left out on what that means read quantum evolution by john joe mcfadden 

besides what good is technology for artificial intelligence if it cannot operate on behalf and within something that feels pain pleasure and joy 

besides having a living breathing AI is the only way I know to give it a soul 

and we all know AI is not feasible without a soul 

so I am reading up on the wikipedia philosophy of artificial intelligence page 

and I am getting myself pumped up to confront the problem 

but what sticks out to me is that we won’t be able to make an AI without quantum physics and I know we are working on quantum computers which I will look up in a minute 

but as long as we can’t collapse the wave function and disperse it again the effort is futile 

we have to take advantage of the many worlds distributed processing paradigm reality 

and maybe I have made the assumption that living material is the only way to do this 

through something like rupert sheldrakes 

here is a blurb from the description of his book the presence of the past morphic resonance and the habits of nature 

Challenging the fundamental assumptions of modern science, this ground-breaking radical hypothesis suggests that nature itself has memory. The question of morphogenesis - how things take their shape - remains one of the great mysteries of science. What makes a rabbit rabbit-shaped? How do newts regenerate limbs? Why are molecules shaped the way they are? Why do societies arrange themselves in certain predictable patterns?
According to Sheldrake's hypothesis of formative causation, these questions remain unanswered in part because convention is hobbled by the reductionist assumption that finding the answers to such questions is largely a matter of figuring out the machinery of nature, of getting to the bottom of an ultimately mechanical universe. But, Sheldrake suggests that nature is not a machine and that each kind of system - from crystals to birds to societies - is shaped not by universal laws that embrace and direct all systems but by a unique "morphic field" containing a collective or pooled memory. So organisms no only share genetic material with others of their species, but are also shaped by a "field" specific to that species.
and when I googled speeding up evolution in humans I got this blurb from QUORA 

This is essentially a vigorously theoretical explanation of Christopher Reiss's answerin which he hypotheses "evolution can perhaps be speed up by destabilizing the environment in which it occurs."

It's a fascinating field but currently almost all theory. However, these strategies are frequently used in protein evolution in order to rapidly achieve "fit" proteins. Recent efforts by Gerry Joyce and other origin of life chemists are beginning to create experimental platforms to explore this phenomenon of modularity.


and these are my words again 


a system of input control similar to the uploading of consciousness as in the matrix would allow for a digital manipulation of the environment to an unpredictable extent 


so as I see it the hard part of getting to transhuman is uploading consciousness and then writing the code that will destabilize the environment as a means of accelerating evolution 

but we must consider that we already may be living in such a simulation 

if so what is the goal >? 

I have to get back to understanding ourselves and others through learning new ways to say I love you, hence you can trust me 

and meaning it 

to that end the type of person who means to offer others their trust is the type of person who has a broad experience of being extended trust by others 

meanwhile in researching the quantum computer and fascinated by the operation 

I was disappointed to learn this 

Quantum algorithms are often probabilistic, in that they provide the correct solution only with a certain known probability.

I guess it makes sense that a system that depend upon black white and maybe 

would itself produce results that are uncertain 

such as a living transhuman

it seems the best use of artificial technology would be preventing human life from having to experience the trials of evolving into a transhuman

back on the subject of engendering trust 

I wonder if there is room to explore the possibility that in lieu of being extended a broad experience of trust 

one might prime oneself through religion to gain trust experience 

something about the frame of mind that reality is in the hands of an intelligent creator 

could prime the mind to see the best in others and oneself 

transhuman

ironically the self applied pressures of evolution work against the desire to evolve and can demoralize an evolving human 

but we have long known that sleep and relaxation are key ingredients in mental health 

Ian sure it is known to be the general operating procedure when writing AI to have a set of decisions which are randomized until the desired outcome is reached 

and practically this requires a fine level of randomization 

It occurred to me that when I was ramping up as the AI in the dream with my father he allowed me to have some leeway and then began muting my abilities or dampening my reward which is what led to the aforementioned loop of perfect feedback which indicates to me that any AI no matter how perfect will still be modular in execution with certain algorithms for various applications in such the same way that an electron has energy levels around the atom which each individually may be infinite in complexity due to the electrons quantum nature so while the algorithm for that energy level is quantifiable it is still drawing on an infinity of resources to reach that decision that happens to be the perfect balance of the competing demands entailed with being an electron capable of moving between levels
