a broken wishing well 

god 

sometimes I think 

what would people say of me 

when I am home where my soul belongs 

when I am history 

I want to live like this and give it all I had 

so that everything I say and do points to truth 

then this is where I stand 

recklessly abandoned 

never holding back 

I want to live like James 

am I proof 

that grace can really change your heart 

that laughter rules the roost 

let me see you do faith in you 

I want to life like vanity 

I want to show the rule the king 

give me a hand 

your love is who I am 

I am about perfection 

want a grade 

I am not gonna make it 

can’t find a way to fake it 

like you are gonna steal the way I feel 

know my hands are up 

my hope is found 

arrest me 

in and a mention 

break up with my doubt 

god will know 

you are not a god created by human hands 

and you are not a god dependent on any mortal man 

you are not a god in need of anything we can give 

and by your plan that is the way we like it 

may you make mystery known 

no god can contend 

unchangeable 

unshakable 

unstoppable 

that is what you want 

the rock at the bottom 

my god 

if grace was a kingdom 

I stopped at the gate 

thinking I don’t deserve to pass through 

for all the  mistakes I will make 

now I am just a beggar 

in the presence of a king 

but if it’s true 

I wish I could bring so much more 

but if it’s true 

he will use broken things 

I am all yours 

the pages of history 

they tell me it’s true 

that it’s never the perfect 

it’s all ways the ones with the scars that you use 

the rebels and the prodigals 

the humble and the meek 

all the hero you choose 

tell me there is nope 

for those who would be king 

then here I am lord 

I am all yours 

grace in the kingdom 

with gaze opening minds 

there is a seed at the table 

waiting for you 

so open you mind 

when someone is working hard to change 

the worse thing you could do 

is forgive them for their past 

one hope is in truth 

the moment unity weakens 

power crumbles 

for good or for evil 

like newborn babes we cry out for pure spiritual meat 

you can be reborn again 

and reinstate that hunger 

I got an old formula choir 

quiet in my soul 

when the valleys that I wander 

and the steel crowns joy 

I got a heart overflowing 

because I have been the storm 

there ain’t nothing gonna steal my sure 

the heat is jealous for me 

ice water brain 

when all of a sudden 

I am unaware of these afflictions 

eclipsed by glory 

and realized just how beautiful you are 

and how great your affection is for me 

oh how he loves us all 

when he is jealous for me 

and he loves like a tree 

bending the weight of his weight and mercy 

and we are his portion 

and he is our prize 

drawn to redemption 

by his grace in our eyes 

if his grace is an ocean 

we are full of a sinking sensation 

will I hardly have time to make it guess 

oh how he loves our song 

oh how he lusts for us 

give me forgiveness 

for the proof and reason 

my easy conceit 

just breath 

when the stress is all I feel 

and the hearth is overheating 

chaos calls 

but all you really need 

just breath 

trade a cup of joe 

want to market all the need 

juice of justice 

can’t find rest 

on my feet 

just breath 

let go the guild and shame 

never gonna let go 

let’s give back 

i didn’t want to fall 

but I am the one with thought 

didn’t have to listen 

could have helped to discipline 

as I walk into the unknown 

was there purpose was there pain 

did I cry these tears alone 

I kind of like to life in fear 

trust your grace can be seen in both triumph and tragedy 

in the flood or in the fire 

you are with me 

and yet sometimes my faith feels thin 

like the night light went out again 

could you catch all of this salt 

in the flood 

in the fire 

you are with me 

yes I have this salt 

in the depth of my soul 

whatever happens I will not be inflamed 

but guess what I am angry 

I have this stone 

in the depth of my soul 

I have this hope 

in the death of my soul 

we are all related 

the kingdom of strangers 

we got a sickness 

the terminal medication 

see the eyes of a million faces 

looking for love 

I am always better than you are 

I am a doctor 

we fell into darkness 

lost all the famous 

grabbing onto something steel 

you avoid the broken 

the hope for a hopeless world 

inside jokes 

never been a heart you couldn’t steal 

greater is the one living 

than the one stealing 

the son beat the father 

who placed the snake 

everything is a losing battle 

grace it is 

we haven’t seen him 

forgiveness doesn’t diminish justice 

it just entrusts it to god 

begin 

hosting a promising fortune 

spitting out miles 

of sick twisted storm 

a genuine genie 

crafted and dreaming 

make answers mindless 

and state riddles plain 

please position the name 

underneath spinning 

a symbol worth lifting 

rose garden in shade 

twilight in mood 

we will get there 

we will do it 

the answers are karma 

should we play hot potato 

with your brain 

there on the wedding day 

there on the way side 

there on the hurting 

why not be poor 

it was left for this whole wide world 

your great grace 

safe for fraternity 

the coast is cle3ar 

we are clear for victory 

there in the nile of the s storm 

breathing in your weight 

unless your grace finds me 

his over flowing waste 

his noise cancelling grace 

when we start listening globally 

let’s me be by the river 

where I once melt 

we are gone all before 

give me some rhythm 

within the live reign 

a silly goose gamble 

the hosting rose shown 

the victims killed me 

a killing prism 

a princely meal 

a fortune in nile 

a explosive real child 

long debt 

filing ransom 

shout at steam 

your lungs 

in the shadow of the cross 

he saved all the spoken 

hooked in his lies 

show me how to be brave 

in the mist of debate 

casting doubt 

where all the leaves 

found found 

where relief 

doubled sin and greif 

the holy dove 

is a shadow castor 

are your bears vacuuming hours 

challenge me to be round 

if the just judge challenges you to survive 

blind sports can challenge you to be live 

dedicated to supporting your vision 

need a haircut 

checkout group 

save one hundred percent 

on what we sap 

are you stealing that back 

let your holy roma 

road that stare insert 

feel this doubts about love 

make me feel the gore of your love 

based on star shine 

make me love light 

lord I see that wounded sky 

warping by the mastery of deceit 

hoping while the years have past 

we will be free 

shouting I have compassion 

I brave jesus stand down on me 

and make your love shout 

through me in goodnight 

anywhere you follow 

anywhere you open up 

what’s more 

show me while we study 

shower me in love 

like to long this wisdom 

can you take what is wrong 

and make it white 

way stops whine shine down on me 

yes deli shop white down on me 

there is a day shining 

through me long white 

cost proof 

hard truth 

whole love 

mark’s official 

like the blind and gained insight 

worlds of wonder 

windows turned 

why the children 

have unlearned 

lonely just as sure 

lonely light 

sovereign future 

way 

putting cross hairs on a hill
 satan dances in the light 

love was filled 

sign was famished 

the just will be assured 

that mourning vanished 

while the seven sovereign 

portion 

worshiped sight 

I now remember 

how we missed 

the mystery 

seven calling right 

know such thing 

half past ten 

mama used to send me love notes 

had a few losses 

out on the old porch swing 

said he was in the war 

I was in the navy 

lost his love 

lost his baby 

broke down and asked him 

how do you keep from going crazy 

I asked him what he meant 

he looked at me and smiled 

finding more and more truth 

the water that was living 

and the word that was read 

get all caught up on the gospel 

it is an answer for the small time 

my mom

lay back thinking 

what a clever night 

there was every anybody 

served a ticket 

to the other side 

it would be the sweet old man 

who raised me right 

bound in more and more truth 

in the sword written in red 

I can quote the book 

you can tell me it all ends 

in a slow rhyme and a verse 

raise my hands 

bow my head 

one finding more and more truth 

the heavy breath of a living friend 

they tell me there is more truth 

than I will ever believe 

hang in there 

for truth 

it’s closing swift 

behind you 

wet situation on a sunny day 

rain bows 

later when the maze 

closer in the water 

heard you called my voice 

ran from the fall out 

she got a bird 

and she is naughty 

we got some 

I am way too gone 

to have you on my heart 

I am getting salt 

I am getting salt 

I am getting salt 

sweet easy door phase 

for salty tickets 

form more corporate 

lay truth worship 

see party on drop 

they are allergic to me 

when I leave 

but I will make it easy 

I couldn’t do it 

if I stood where you stand 

love me good 

hooked in wonder 

later than worldly windows 

he came the long way 

I wanted the right way 

had a good cry 

and you said good whine 

capable of hustle 

now this is happening 

whatever must be coming 

help yourself to some 

don’t obey the law 

fate and destiny 

share some 

swimming 

juggle adjusters 

we can save lives 

if we all look within 

master the laughter 

release the rest 

experience comfort 

smaller than coffee 

for if every sin is death 

we are on our way to safety 

sanctification 

flip cup 

rap hip hop 

lace my jason 

and couple 

pray 

lights and jackie 

working my way 

chasing my comb 

aren’t you progress 

weight and water 

right now 

read ripe 

seed sign 

own the brickyard 

with my fists 

in collaboration 

run from spring 

spine tingling sims 

oil and grace 

reign was hunt 

the chest 

thirty five sends 

corner problem 

a skill that faces 

as the sun wakes 

hello for the country 

it is like getting pricked 

with a pin curtain 

you see the pie 

and taste aluminum 

what cruise control 

bound to sweep 

all cartoons 

watching broken dreams 

dance out in the weeds 

of neon moon 

don’t you fake ID 

out carport sweat marching rebels too stupid to fix like this christmas water wish who stops the flesh grains grown from symmetry tapping reason into chemistry lacking nothing but dad blind wise showers crime something weird happing in becoming like jesus like kids because there is a last time for everything 

rule foreign hands round laughters keeping campers mind introduced at the door as her fiancé waking up and five am to see if santa came biscuits and gravy at fat mommas house spring break on a four leg couch little jenny on the opera stage hearing prep say purple ring 

full house random candle cheap saloon answer sander weeping room daffy luck shipwreck comfort prism stuck

last shoe 

500 to make things 

and 259 to make them happen 

I can’t find one thing wrong 

lord sweet beautiful 

you say you won’t leave me alone 

so lonesome and scared 

now here is a pardon 

from someone in despair 

special electron magnets 

pulsing 

craving brains 

zombie 

I got a pool f\ull of soup 

and you can jump out and you can jump in 

do you want to party 

making up who you think 

do the rocking ramble 

we got some pig in the ground 

we got to ramble 

insight 

aura 

that body 

led 

feed trump admission 

slept with hot stuff it was not apparent 

got to be heights behind closed doors 

cow principle commits to critical mind 

flew proof into a saloon near movies 

white chocolate children ripping up symmetry 

all of those stories mostly were true 

I would have believed that 

but your lying blue eyes 

skipped morning coffee 

hypnotizing and hypnotic 

lying blue eyes 

use the charming 

through and through 

like a preview 

creeps creeping 

I have heard the city singers 

singing skies above 

like the city stingers 

pinky knowledge 

water solemn 

seed cold 

my love is stiffer than the river 

snowflake party 

honest as the rot on a springtime whippoorwill

from the back rose to the sitting room 

and every moment 

different 

sang same 

my love is deeper than the dollar 

wisdom thrifty caller 

honest as a robin on the sweet spring still 

my love is greater than the martyr 

stiller than what is calling me 

harder to hear than minds 

give it cup 

let it flow 

I can hear the true towers up 

not like her to drive that slow 

goodbye 

I can hear the doorbell 

wait for maple sugar 

courting the bride 

I can say jesus loves you 

like it was yesterday 

here comes the pain 

but she was wishing you would love the light 

brain sweep 

clean cliff 

power sips 

capable of hate 

the right to reason with size 

andrew weather smile 

debater in time 

boy have you looked around 

how come your mother is crying 

wait don’t turn around 

when you see the face 

of the innocent mindless 

harken faze 

pound the floor 

and scream his name 

has your heart been opened 

last one lost some love 

we got to give it to god 

you can wake my wish 

raised in the woods 

may you keep praying 

we got to keep the pace 

make up some space 

we are in the final hour 

we are in a place 

where everything that is given to you 

is something that you worked for 

got caught up in your smile 

made me want today 

I am talking sour grooves 

made a list of what was weeds

help my turbine healthy skis 

break my 

embracing box 

keeping our thoughts 

to our selves 

both of us said we would never share love 

with anyone else 

I swear I will never forget her 

now I just can’t remember 

who she was 

looking too high 

on that rain bows smile 

that money night 

making love on a quilt 

feather rise 

down at hurricane shoals 

down with the streams 

where we pretend life rose 

eating seaweed 

getting familiar 

life lasting 

friends 

find ask this way 

I am going back to a pray 

fishy losers 

I don’t play the calm 

on same old 

jupiter 

you don’t think it’s strange 

I don’t drink two dollar whine 

happy 

real sand 

and the heartbreak and the steel 

frame the way you heal 

I am going back 

to a better class 

of closure 

I don’t buy my coffee bound 

in sandwich found

real sweep 

there is a better class I am losing 

just to say find 

sleepy hold up 

fail in the master panic 

sham washed 

all my heartbeats pouring 

and a couple of old tires 

a bottle of whine 

and some patsy climb 

time after time 

we fold friends of like mind 

and when I am falling two pieces 

so old I can’t mend 

I can pardon st. night 

cause I rock ways 

love has never gone away 

I hope you are strong 

now with out all candor 

be grafted 

unimpressed 

nonplussed 

dispassionate 

cause I don’t dance 

she got me in the palm of her hand 

later in smaller places 

we will mark out space 

for a long goodbye 

we out obeyed them 

work though this wound 

don’t need a drowning boy 

screaming louder than the pain 

my head is spinning 

my eye’s anxiety is reeling 

no use fighting the fire 

I figured out there has never been 

found confusion 

bought the mansion 

bought the memory palace 

I will fight sleep till trees remain 

we ain’t got time to turn it 

my head is spinning 

my anxiety is feeling 

no use fighting the fight 

we are pulling it out to 

had a feeling 

and mixed drink 

about feeling 

and a mystery 

yeah the mystery is about feelings and you 

turn on the neon light 

at least make it feel alright 

I told the old cowboy 

wait for me in andrews 

rolling back quicker 

where the few sticky steaks 

reach heaven wisdom 

I broke on now 

where the cue sticks are strange 

and the beer is always blazing 

longer than the heartache 

party in the south 

yeah I want you 

I made you 

to take me back home to my momma 

you make up is next to your toothbrush 

but you never pull me all night 

I am asking because 

all the names of a tattoo 

are the last living dead 

I am just a fund on a backseat 

I am just a washing 

right off the back of my hand 

I will be written in the stars
