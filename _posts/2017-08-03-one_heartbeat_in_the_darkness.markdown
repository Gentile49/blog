and jamming in the runt 

rutting in commotion 

south grown 

north storm 

the blessings of jesus 

facts of the matter 

objective solids 

subversive media 

impossible calling 

approachable guru 

haunches in hunch

canceling branches 

rusted old 

crunch 

gospel of jesus 

the ransom of lust 

saved by love 

staunch stern leaders 

jesus freaks 

moments under toe 

mistletoe 

master 

leaders suspect 

relief for understanding 

honor it 

allow your spirit 

your in every breath 

and the highest standard 

jews for christ 

nazis in sight 

a sacrifice at night 

rumination sold 

right to be right 

dancers love closure 

the chair is getting tight 

unrest and unwell 

prove me wrong 

can you hear it 

leveraging might 

encountering soon 

bantering horn 

new title 

juniors in wise 

a lifter of grime 

exquisite seldom 

unfailing lines 

wisdom for jews 

surgery for the suburbs 

a literal white out 

climax uncontrollable 

battering rams of avalanche 

scanning the horizon for magic 

and turning down the mystery 

exactly what conducts 

she rummaged in his mind 

approaching design 

jesus manifest 

cold water icy views 

vanity waste 

excrement sandwich 

swarming swarm 

functional landfill

down with the names 

exaggerate titles 

scorning mantles 

hoping you acquit 

gift wrapped 

slapping 

drama 

utter mood 

muttering moon 

clinging hysteria 

uproarious dancer 

a new type of darkness 

that lights a grove 

worn by saints profane 

proudly impressed diversity so golden 

one moment bless radical divisions who need sparks

next moment guess approximations that were meant to be 

sharing fear the last thing you hear before becoming a butterfly 

whispering near the inner ear of a caterpillar 

intimate wander through streets that are strewn with dope rhapsody 

capital standard real swollen and dripping in jealousy

dollars debut when the grandfather clause erupts 

Washington’s Greed promised us a new earth brought about by american power 

Martha and George clamor for affection through out the centuries 

a charismatic eagle designs attacks for the unbroken 

baring teeth keen on wiping out all misfits in prime candidacy 

solid inclusion that wants a welcome shot to be fired 

tap me the tape is spelling compromise with a silent why 

the blind  are leading me down pathways and alleyways that I have heretofore no experience with  

a groundswell sweeps me up and dumps me off in treasure so pure 

I can’t wait for the timetable to call itself 

that is when the listening weirdness and magic break out 

 
this is the end of the world as we know it 

don’t switch the bad on the dying shades of yore 

making you feel humbled and honored to be in his presence 

I would love to tell you stay inside the lines 

but something is better on the other side 

hyperspace is in trouble folks 

people are stealing our children dreams 

we are those people 

my shade has come apart and my nerves are all steel 

shut out the light when leaving 

while we lay there 

make him be lovely 

stranger sat out the 

the prism of impatience 

focuses all of our yesterdays bygone 

into timing divinity and god 

so endure 

satisfaction if for fast cats 

who run rather than let curiosity cost them a life 

what time do you have to be back to heaven 

these heavenly arms can’t hold me 

and I would stop the hands of time 

we better yet compute the rhyme 

when I miss you it’s divine 

plenty of escorts found in zanzibar 

hearts burning like flames 

rising so high we transpire 

my babe my heart is screaming 

turn the sounds into love 

junk rust shy come 

we ain’t been together to long 

let’s get back to the start 

I need more of you 

symbolic ask and tell volley 

driven to lead more 

catch the big fish 

we caught the judge coming up on the radio 

this girl is still free 

kentucky derby 

german auto 

why not me when the nights are cold 

searching for me from sing a longs 

you half see what the world is wrong 

I half built it 

and I have tasted and I have wasted 

a woman’s love 

talk face to face 

germinating risk 

tamborine skips 

there were children in the trash 

such a beautiful joke 

got a death wish baby 

don’t want you to save me 

she lets her hair down 

got to fit so we stand up 

commitments adding up 

closing in got me holding like a junkie 

dying for a kid that’s got love 

going out of my mind 

bussing up crews 

got a death wish baby 

dying for you to save me 

we could have a little 

rock picker wrapping round all that is wrong 

don’t miss me 

I am already gone 

anyway you looking it’s a hell of a view 

don’t know where we are going to be but I know we are going to be sitting on top of the swirl 

anywhere you catch me 

the right type of tipsy 

she called me unjust 

when you got the love 

holding onto heaven 

dreams scrimmage 

hard to field 

he has faced non existence 

and come up wanting 

tell disney she was his cousin 

I want to go home 

plant of dime 

utmost coy 

I dream about the girl who has been waiting for so long 

ice water for legs 

business ends 

big in detroit city 

all the letters that I write they think I am fine 

one day I am late at bars 

I will take my foolish pride and put it in the southbound freighter for christ 

they say sunflower yellow can  take your breath away 

but my favorite color is being left off 

the bugs I wrote the bay Pslam work book from 

few found a ghost that cut through the storm 

we call all the riots 

he is always in trouble 

meek rot 

you know I have seen it all in the arms of the song 

victor anderson 

was a happy guy 

she always hugged his necklace 

furniture movers explain 

we call the shots in the air play shower

foul balls 

raisin in the sun 

you give me hope you give me reason 

your love amazes me 

I prayed for miracles that never came 

got down on my knees in the pouring rain 

but only you could save me 

your loves emboldened 

don’t you hope for more than reason 

you just couldn’t get what I was thinking 

beyond imagination 

selling you believing now 

sarah must be reading 

holding for maybe 

weight falls down 

he is holding you 

believe me now

selling baby powder 

cups full I am drowning 

cut across town 

somebody up there has me 

don’t pinch me I know I am dreaming 

cut the crap we are winning weird

love to stuff fingers in wallets 

these heavenly hands that hold me 

genius in legion 

can’t believe your eyes 

fair calm 

stare lights down 

darkness harnessed 

let’s blow out these city lights 

give up on quitting time 

shouts my name out in the wind 

live up on the ridge 

won’t you come with me tonight 

where midnight drifts 

moonlights kiss 

high up on the ridge 

hi honey 

home child 

when he hears that old new now 

where are you blind 

candor quits slipping 

come on girls step into the breathing room 

call on me tonight where moonlight drips into your eyes 

I just want one little kiss 

we will be up high upon the ridge 

slip me some missions 

call before you dig 

new service 

increased you help 

grade inclines 

just take a sip 

my cup is a hurricane 

where a larger than life dorothie 

spins farther 

glimpses father 

and christmas day changes 

hold tight we are perfecting the body shuffle 

limbo is mandatory 

and all that was signed I sold 

it been a grind a number of days and that’s why I left you behind 

come monday I will be alright 

I spent an eternity in prison for crimes wisdom maker 

the judge will be on shortly 

all I saw was smoke and fire 

didn’t feel a thing 

and that’s why I fake my biggest mistake 

down with this life of love 

and I wonder would I give my life 

if I came into a fortune 

would you hold me dear 

there is a brother one my left a brother on my right 

weighing on my mind 

trying to be a homeboy 

I might not want to die 

promises promises heavenly promises 

you don’t think about rain 

you just think about wrong 

and I would do the same for you 

adjust my work

I would give my life 

Would make that sacrifice 

at the drop of a pin 

food tastes better 

down at the auto dealership 

the past is called something to take it’s place 

you get a live person on the phone 

not some cold automated machine 

it must have been cold there in my shadow 

aint no sun 

aint no blue sky 

hyperspace is in trouble 

but we decide who gets funded 

walking to jerusalem 

marching with methusala 

raving like a lunatic 

one more time 

talk is cheap 

the only thing we have to fear is danger 

the rose is sharp 

by the tell me I am the one 

I will be sticking out my thumb 

walking to jerusalem 

there is a difference between living and living wealth 

that standard you obeyed for charisma 

can’t have it all by yourself 

something is always missing 

till you share it with someone else 

where else will you find shelter from the storm 

living wealth 

he lost his girlfriend in a car wreck on a grave day in may 

bicycles lost in the rain 

cinderella the pages are ruined 

choosing to acknowledge truth 

does the shoe fit you now 

alice expanded uncontrollably 

decisive revisions 

on some beach 

somewhere 

he stuck that needle down deep in my arm 

hot on the trail of the impossibly young 

sought personal deliverance by another way 

we settled down and settled large 

one heartbeat in the darkness
