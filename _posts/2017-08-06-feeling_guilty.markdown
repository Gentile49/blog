I will be written in the song 

these creations and creature 

final wisdom 

hurt me badly 

make me underfed 

mad for the whisky 

blame the band for the song 

and the song for the party 

that went all night long 

but it ain’t my fault 

had a little fun 

all the wrong I am done 

blame the devil on the dark 

and the dark on the devil 

cause I am never gonna listen 

I am gonna go to prison 

when your life like out there alone 

keep fighting the good fight 

keep letting your light shine 

wasted breath to listen 

just keep on dancing 

my joy will be our banner 

our prism 

but you hold the key to holding on 

right now 

bright mindless desire 

unmoved 

shifting the doubt 

erasing the pain 

casting caution 

to the wimps 

there is power in the name of Ian 

where his power 

power sips the brim 

the vowel sound E 

the world has gone 

hurt locker lobe 

you are the face the fire the open road 

and the oceans change 

I will clean to youth 

never find our love 

that is stronger than yours for me 

I could save our stars 

never find our love 

that is as strong as you and me 

here I remind myself 

who won’t relent 

won’t forget 

who won’t let go 

as you promise and you whisper to my heart 

as you run 

lead the sun’s shower like eagles 

laughing glades of passionate swans 

I know you are reading anything 

I am waking as  I wake 

your maker is maker 

you brave is great 

your name is greater than anything I face 

as I wait 

new soup walks reason 

home ride banter child 

keep coming the storm is fine 

prime movers shafts of glaring sunlight 

live hard 

die fast 

love money 

a messy world 

where riddles make nice 

candles in the wind 

real style 

i won’t be shy 

because he won’t be shy 

well I called your name a long time ago 

and you sprung a well from a heart of stone 

I was careful then what I let you see 

the less I trust you the less I grow 

where there is hurting 

you show me how the kindness can move 

let me open up my whole heart 

so I am writing now 

ready to let you in 

all the way to the scars beneath my skin 

you don’t look away because you understand 

what a gentle win 

let me open up 

love you with my whole heart 

the less I trust you the less I grow 

the more I love you the more I know 

I don’t have to show 

where there is hurting 

got love in six seconds flat 

tickled pink for a little green golden 

trust the weight 

embrace the security 

enjoy the beauty of possible 

wonderful something 

hurting discernment 

five mistakes 

three hundred and sixty five times 

sold no matter how afraid 

all of creation 

all of the earth 

make straight a high ways 

a path for the words 

later we will comment this out 

comment the sinner 

let every nation 

chapter nine 

there is a justice 

you at forever 

faithful and true 

every heart open like the kind 

king jesus 

you are coming soon 

longing for our key 

we saved 

like her bride 

preparing for coming soon 

even so calm 

lord jesus calm 

angry 

historian 

not the tone of my transgressions 

but the song of my undoing 

my great decider 

to be the few 

to lift my cross 

and give anything 

my time 

given 

cruis content 

let love explode 

and dare the rhyme to lie 

I love to see a soul 

to save a revolution 

let love explode 

and be the dead to rights 

a love so gold 

my job is not dead 

healing is surely appropriate 

be apprised 

my hope arise 

and make the righteous find 

fire 

if my darkness is light 

how great is that light 

god when you choose to move mountains 

I know I am 

where are we capable 

I know the sorrow and the hurt 

will all go away 

when we go along 

tell your heart to beat again 

close your heart and beat again 

close your mind and breath again 

say good bye to where you are 

guilty as sin 

I am forgiven 

our prism is a faded tree of solitude 

branching open without heartfelt formulas 

need it be debated now the heart is radical 

keep on sining garbage in the data solids 

I need a black tiger king of language 

I need an eyes open kind of moment 

need to ride this fire down into the jungle 

can you keep working for the dire insanity 

that creative charisma she worried so well 

the giving genius with gifts he castled my rook 

please believe in long felt goodbyes 

a group of students waved in nostalgia 

when problems possibilities were stolen and free 

sweet big gypsy she whispered missions need 

the crime went out to jesus 

I want to run into traffic 

leave me breathing pennies 

graft lincoln into my brain 

twos swift for moments 

fanout that call back 

there is a mountain 

and a giant 

all of your tears were not a waste 

who spins the window 

pairs of lightening 

you know I sent my son to die 

you know my heart is heavy 

and my mind is deep 

you know I called 

laser focus on control 

i can see the dawn has broken 

I don’t feel the kind of spankings 

my god disciplines me 

I can see the town is breaking 

I don’t leave this town is magic 

I don’t have to think 

I don’t have to understand 

if my broken heart is a part of your plan 

count it all joy 

it is hard to make sense of all your promises 

and I have to remember 

that you are a god 

and I am not 

soul they will be done 

triple threat 

I know you are listening to my heart 

shark one 

olympian zero 

it has been a hard time 

in the valley of peace 

don’t wrap a life 

in the sinners own feet 

there will be nights 

when hurting minds listen 

to all your hard luck 

let your life be made new 

the father is not waiting 

now he is running too 

running straight to you 

heads up seven up 

we look over our shoulders 

reading messages in notes 

can we get back to the alter 

to the arms of fathers love 

like a blinding light 

in the dead of night 

it’s the gospel that makes a way 

it’s the cure for our religion 

to the captive it looks like freedom 

to the orphan it feels like home 

in the worlds we make brave 

to the skeptic it might sound crazy 

in a world where our hearts are bleeding 

to believe in a god who loves 

the soul 

I get so tired 

I can’t move 

how many times have you given me strength 

to just keep breathing 

standing on a road I didn’t plan 

wondering how I got to where I am 

I am trying to hear that still small voice 

I am trying to hear above the noise 

how many times have you heard me cry out 

god please take this 

oh I walk 

I walk through the shadows 

I must stay afraid 

this was the one thing 

I couldn’t see coming 

if you cried 

I pride 

fear and doubt 

who can be honest 

it all works out 

there will be beauty 

where beauty was ash and stone 

you know my soul 

age to age he stands 

and the ending has just began 

the name above all names 

where my heart will sing 

how great is our god 

sing with me 

how great is our god 

we were at church and the worship was dope 

at about the halfway point 

I walked out to get more coffee 

and then had a 2 to four minute conversation with amanda and kevin 

as we were watching the pastor on the live feed 

the music was still playing by all accounts 

and when I went in my girlfriend courtney 

mentioned I had been gone for twenty minutes 

I came in just as the music ended and the pastor had been at it for twenty minutes 

just enough time for him to really tear up my girlfriends heart 

and leave her crying in the arms of the associate pastor sitting down on her left 

the message was great and somebody dropped rescue 

all clear 

the water is fine 

green flag 

I went to a writing group 

to make sure I was in tune 

I will be in trouble 

if I make the most of this 

hang on to the least of these 

when you shout there is no one listening 

I g to a sweet salvation and it’s pitiful 

when the mountains turn to valleys 

that I can climb 

climb on board 

cause he is all 

you will ever need 

 I got a reason to withhold 

patience and anger 

into the darkness shoe shine 

out of the ashes we rhyme 

the nerds make the worst 

dark forces 

light makers 

see shimmering glimpses 

on a brooding and harrowing night 

saw a man at the courthouse 

laughing in possession of a steak knife 

heard the mission bell ring 

words fall short in times like these 

you think the world drags you to it’s knees 

yesterday was a nice surprise 

ruined rags turn riches 

welcome to the hotel california 

where your dreams mean sadness can be deceived 

and two ran into the pain 

one made madness see 

the screams were delightful 

the other spoke of love so frightening 

the kindness that kills 

just put ice cream in your mouth 

and shout a praise report 

and you won’t get brain freeze 

seek near me with your whole heart 

the drivers heading the right lane 

with calm calculation 

were gone before we looked 

more about this in a minute 

read more brave random 

at seek and tell dot com 

the author and redeemer 

the sin of broken man 

dear younger me 

it was not your fault 

you were never meant to carry this beyond the cross 

set apart 

brand new heart 

it hidden in bought 

why not elicit stranded 

screaming for the ransom 

you will lead me from the valley to the heights 
as I wait 

I am gonna walk 

and not grow weary 

read it lifts me up on wings like eagles 

creator braver 

you name is more life giving 

than anything I face 

I see a habit 

rabbits running late 

alice in chains 

what was dead is now regained 

oh I am perfect in life 

just where you want me 

enjoying destiny 

jumping the shark 

discovery channel 

racing 

don’t have the search 

practice wrapping up corn 

shucks this isn’t hard 

it is just one pun after another 

power in his name 

the symbols of darkness 

know lies can’t find us here 

oh god you are my prism 

my peace when waves of trouble fold 

I can search the stars 

never find the love 

that withstood the fall 

the work is good 

the pay is great 

the work is sad 

are you arguing for compassion 

or are you slaughtering desire 

either way you better get hot 

ice water in my veins 

look out kitty kitty 

kitty kye 

kitty go 

kitty ran 

I am learning how to disappear into mercy and truth 

only when we ransom kindness 

will we sustain the fall 

sharing is the love 

I use to remind you 

we broke 

romeo and juliet 

we may never make it yet 

can you get where I won’t let you 

cherish is the word 

cherish the strength 

makes me forget 

that I am stealing your soul 

close to my healing 

it’s up to you 

red red whine 

like this spawn 

thought about you 

I was wrong 

just one thing makes me forget 

stay close to me 

don’t let me be 

these starry eyed bombs 

and this song can beat down 

thoughts of you leave my head 

I was wrong 

now I found 

don’t let me be another 

it’s there in the bar 

see them walking hand in hand across the bridge at midnight 

heads turning as the lights flashing so bright 

and the sister calling as a frenzy on the way down her spine 

girls on film 

lipstick cherry all on the lens she is calling 

look for the stare marble 

why the baby is smiling 

you just made a million 

light twisting holding tight 

give me shudders and a whisper 

uptown shooters found 

two minutes later 

see you together 

this is a story about bobby sue 

it’s a big gun house 

and live sound tune 

they headed down to big al paso 

and rubbed a butt 

billy mack is a detective down in texas 

he has got a joke and he knows what the fact is 

in fact action requires indecision 

self control 

pact of action

requires self control 

a run on the roll 

steam rollers 

bland candles 

wasted states 

melting toons 

dream of better lives 

the kind which never hate 

dropped in a state of imaginary grace 

I will stop the world and melt with you 

have you seen the difference 

see it’s getting better all the time 

maybe I am going blasted 

maybe I am going blind 

some smoke and mirrors for reason 

alice was a widow in disease 

comparisons will compound 

she shatters the listening design 

a love letter to instant magic 

personal tear drops 

rain down on me 

once french always fresh 

do the bad mamajama 

stool pigeons drunk on knives 

one mindless situation aligned 

I am not tough

you are about it 

leading all me head 

would you bring me home 

we wrecked some songs 

wasn’t trying to be under fed 

I was trying to be a sad song 

told you twice 

I was only trying to be nice 

hey now why should I 

feeling guilty
